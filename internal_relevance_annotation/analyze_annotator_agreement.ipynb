We use the 80 samples with perfect agreement or consensus, do a 50-50 train-test split (using 40 samples for training few shot classifier, then later 40 for just testing and reporting on that), and report the agreement, etc. for the 100-sample in an appendix. We concede that relevance-annotation is a somewhat subjective task.\n",
    "2. We do all above, but use all 100 labeled samples for train-test split -- in the 20 cases with disagreement, we use the majority label as the label. \n",
    "3. We discuss the 20 samples that do not have consensus and discuss the disagreement, do some consensus-building, and do another round of 100-sample annotation (different sample) post-discussion. Multiple rounds of annotation and discussion to build consensus is also a popular strategy: we then report agreement, etc. on that next annotation iteration, and use those labeled samples instead. We may have a higher agreement or consensus-ratio, indicating that the relevance-annotation task is more or less objective?"
