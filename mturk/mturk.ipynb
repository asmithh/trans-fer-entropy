    "\n",
    "The unanimous three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that Braidwood Management, which runs an alternative health center in Texas, cannot be sued by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its policy that employees who engage in homosexual or gender non-conforming conduct will be fired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit Judge Jerry Smith wrote for the majority that without the shield, the company would be forced to “comply wholeheartedly” with policy it sees as “sinful,” upholding a ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the court reversed O’Connor’s ruling that Braidwood could bring the case as a class action on behalf of other religious businesses. That means the exemption now only applies directly to Braidwood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smith was joined by Circuit Judges Edith Clement and Cory Wilson. All three judges were appointed by Republican presidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EEOC and a lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Braidwood sued the EEOC after the agency updated its enforcement guidance in 2021 to reflect the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which said bias against gay and transgender workers is a form of unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company said it was run according to Christian beliefs, including opposition to homosexuality and upholding specific gender roles. It had sought a court order shielding it from EEOC enforcement under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law limiting government agencies’ ability to burden anyone’s religious freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company is separately suing the Biden administration over the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that health insurance plans, including those funded by employers, cover preventive care services including HIV-preventing drugs, which Braidwood also says violates its beliefs. O’Connor, who is also presiding over that case, ruled in the company’s favor in that case, though the order is partly on hold for now.\n",

    "Hate crimes toward LGBTQ people rose 70% between 2020 and 2021, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program’s most recent data. Reports like that, and state laws impacting LGBTQ rights, are influencing pride plans across the country.\n",

    "Every June, companies known as notable LGBTQ allies, like Target and Anheuser-Busch, commemorate Pride Month in the fashion of most annual celebrations: with targeted advertising and profitable merchandise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, however, corporate pride and its rainbow displays have been shoved back into the closet in response to increasingly vocal and demonstrative “anti-woke” pushback. Perhaps most notably, Target removed its famous Pride Collection from stores after waves of homophobic opposition, leaving gay and trans customers to face that vitriol without so much as a rainbow T-shirt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is merely a drop in the bucket of American corporations abandoning their yearly statements of solidarity in response to hateful comments under nearly every Pride-themed social media post.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the official Major League Baseball Twitter account only had its rainbow profile picture up for a few hours before calls for a boycott filled the comments, while XBOX only had its Pride logo up for one day before callously changing it to a fiery hell-inspired version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although companies have been mocked for “rainbow capitalism” in the past, a commemorative rainbow logo is a harmless and simple gesture of support for a historically marginalized group. Deleting a social media post may seem innocuous, but when companies abandon the rainbow logos — and seemingly side with a vocal homophobic minority — it not only goes against everything Pride stands for but also poses a serious health risk to LGBTQ individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suicide, depression and other health risks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a medical student at the University of Chicago, I have encountered and cared for innumerable gay and trans patients, who are at a disproportionate risk for a myriad of health issues including depression, homelessness, addiction, targeted violence and suicide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elevated risk is explained by the minority stress model, a tool that shows external and internal “stressors” — such as discrimination, victimization and internalized homophobia —contribute to the development of these health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinion Newsletter\n",
    "\n",
    "So when homophobia is spewed in the comments of every Pride post on social media, and when companies show a lack of integrity by backing down in the face of those comments, it could actively contribute to higher rates of suicide, self-harm and depression among queer people, particularly children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homophobia is nothing new, but this is the first year in recent memory that it has been loud enough to scare companies into pulling back or even eliminating their marketing to the LGBTQ community.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is doubly disastrous for queer people. First, it communicates that companies are listening to and siding with hateful commenters, adding to the stress of victimization in the LGBTQ community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the minority stress model also shows that representation and open displays of support actually reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with stressors. So by deleting their rainbow profile pictures, companies are also removing a critical tool to prevent increased rates of depression, suicide and self-harm in queer youth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that a corporation posting a yassified version of their logo — adding a beauty filter — will prevent a trans child from killing themselves. However, it will contribute to the likelihood that my future medical colleagues and I may encounter a queer patient who points to this Pride season as the month they learned to hate themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly during a year when hundreds of anti-queer, and particularly anti-trans, laws have been introduced and, in several cases, passed, it is dire to ensure our queer youth feel supported and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "All is not lost, however, for there are still abundant opportunities to celebrate and show appreciation for the queer community the rest of this Pride Month and all year round. Social and familial support buffers the effects of minority stressors, as well as engagement with other members of the community.\n",

    "Attending your local Pride events, checking in on your queer loved ones and supporting queer initiatives can provide necessary support.\n",

    "Also, I applaud Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s signing of HB4664 earlier this year, protecting gender-affirming care patients and providers in Illinois.\n",

    "I urge companies to reassess the bad example they are setting by scaling back their Pride. Doing so sends an internalized message that we should back down to hate. Standing up to anti-gay and anti-trans legislation and sentiment is exactly why Pride Month exists; now is the time to stand in solidarity and action for the LGBTQ community.

    "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Dozens of transgender people in Florida have turned to crowdfunding appeals to help them leave the state after the passage of new legislation that targets the LGBTQ+ community, including a law that curtails access to gender-affirming care for adults and bans it for minors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Sage Chelf, the decision to leave hardly felt like a choice, but she didn’t have the funds to cover a move. The 30-year-old trans woman, who lives in the Orlando area, was nearly out of one medication when she found out the clinic that had been prescribing her hormone therapy was ending all treatment for trans patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t want to go back to the person that I was forced to be at the time,” Chelf said, of the years before she transitioned in 2021. “It was a very dark time in my life. I would rather just not be alive, I guess, then have to go back to living not trans.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Chelf was among dozens who made an appeal for donations online, saying they needed help to leave Florida in anticipation of or in reaction to a law that took effect May 17. In addition to banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, the law places new restrictions on adults seeking treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of people seeking help online is a fraction of the 94,900 transgender adults estimated to live in Florida by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, which looked at state-level, population-based surveys. Many, if not most, will stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all trans people seek medical interventions. But for those who do, losing access to hormone therapy, or interrupting other care, can be devastating for their mental health. Over time, they can lose some of the sex characteristics generated by the hormones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chelf, who works as a leasing agent in Orlando, figured she would need $2,500 to cover the cost of moving and finding a new job. She was stunned to raise more than $3,000 online in less than two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was under the impression that no one’s going to actually donate, people are going to think I’m just trying to like, get free money,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "People have given $200,000 since January to fundraisers on GoFundMe started by trans people seeking to leave Florida, according to data from the platform. Jalen Drummond, GoFundMe’s director of public affairs, said the online fundraising platform saw a 39% increase from April to May in the number of fundraisers created to help trans people leave the state because of the changing laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s still a pittance in terms of overall charitable giving, but it has a big impact for people like Chelf. Such mutual aid helps make up for the overall underfunding of nonprofits that serve the LGBTQ+ community.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent study found that those organizations received 0.13% of the $426 billion in overall charitable giving in 2019, the most recent year that IRS data on donations to tax-exempt organizations was available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for that low figure is that many nonprofits that primarily serve the LBGTQ+ community are small, grassroots organizations that don’t have a lot of fundraising capacity, said Una Osili, associate director for research and international programs at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. She’s hopeful that the school’s research can be a resource for both donors and nonprofits seeking additional funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report does not look at funds exchanged directly between individuals. However, Elise Colomer-Cheadle, development director for Outright International, said it’s likely that the most vulnerable in the LBGTQ+ community — older people, rural residents, immigrants and trans people — do not have their needs met.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While their movement is the largest it’s ever been historically in the last 55 years, it’s still not big enough to serve all of the needs of this population against the backdrop of a very well-funded and very hateful opposition,” said Colomer-Cheadle, whose organization advocates for the human rights of LGBTQ+ people and populations around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There’s a sense of: The opposition is out for blood and our lives are at stake,” she said. “And if we don’t step up for ourselves, it’s possible that nobody else will. It’s a very, very scary time.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Campaign for Southern Equality, which advocates for the LGBTQ+ community, is providing direct grants of $500 to the families of transgender minors across the South and to transgender adults in Florida. It is close to reaching its goal of raising $250,000 in additional funds to distribute this year, said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the organization’s executive director.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are having folks reach out out-of-the-blue, multiple times a week saying, ‘Hey, never connected with your organization before. I’m hosting a fundraiser for you tomorrow night thousands of miles from here. I’ll send you the money.’ That’s pretty incredible.” Beach-Ferrara said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chelf hopes to move to Illinois and move in with her girlfriend. The donations to her GoFundMe have restored her faith in humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think everyone’s aware of how dire the situation actually is,” she said.\n",

    "Decades of medical experience and research since has found that when patients are treated for gender dysphoria, their self-esteem grows and their stress, anxiety, substance use and suicidality decrease. In 2018, Cornell University’s Center for the Study of Inequality released a comprehensive literature review finding that gender transition, including hormones and surgery, “improves the well-being of transgender people.” Nathaniel Frank, the project’s director, said that “a consensus like this is rare in social science.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cornell review also found that regret — a decision to either stop treatment or express unhappiness about one’s decision to transition socially, medically or surgically — became even less common as surgical quality and social support improved. All procedures in medicine and surgery inspire some percentage of regret. But a study published in 2021 found that fewer than 1 percent of those who have received gender-affirming surgery say they regret their decision to do so, a much lower rate than has been reported for more common medical interventions like plastic surgery and orthopedic care. A separate analysis of a survey of more than 27,000 transgender and gender-diverse adults found that the vast majority of those who detransition from medical affirming treatment said they did so because of external factors (such as family pressure, financial reasons or a loss of access to care), not because they had been misdiagnosed or their gender identities had changed.\n",

    "When considering the growing body of overwhelmingly positive data about adult transgender treatment, it makes sense that earlier intervention, which can lessen the permanent effects of puberty, would make gender transition easier for teenagers. Puberty blockers had been used with minimal concern about side effects since the 1980s. They have been approved by the F.D.A. to treat endometriosis, prostate cancer and precocious puberty. When used for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, they allow for an additional safeguard as gender-diverse patients become more certain about their identities through ongoing evaluation, family support and review. Offered shortly after puberty begins, blockers are typically used to delay puberty for as long as two years. Decreasing bone density — a side effect of puberty blockers — can return to normal once puberty resumes, either by withdrawing the blockers or administering cross-sex hormones.\n",

    "The presumption that gender-diverse identities are not real — that young people will eventually come to accept their birth assigned gender as their minds catch up to their maturing bodies — is not supported by the evidence and is likely harmful. There are, after all, more than 40 identified intersex variations representing diversity in the development of genitalia. Gender identity is similarly diverse.

      "Decades of medical experience and research since has found that when patients are treated for gender dysphoria, their self-esteem grows and their stress, anxiety, substance use and suicidality decrease. In 2018, Cornell University’s Center for the Study of Inequality released a comprehensive literature review finding that gender transition, including hormones and surgery, “improves the well-being of transgender people.” Nathaniel Frank, the project’s director, said that “a consensus like this is rare in social science.”\n",

      "The Cornell review also found that regret — a decision to either stop treatment or express unhappiness about one’s decision to transition socially, medically or surgically — became even less common as surgical quality and social support improved. All procedures in medicine and surgery inspire some percentage of regret. But a study published in 2021 found that fewer than 1 percent of those who have received gender-affirming surgery say they regret their decision to do so, a much lower rate than has been reported for more common medical interventions like plastic surgery and orthopedic care. A separate analysis of a survey of more than 27,000 transgender and gender-diverse adults found that the vast majority of those who detransition from medical affirming treatment said they did so because of external factors (such as family pressure, financial reasons or a loss of access to care), not because they had been misdiagnosed or their gender identities had changed.\n",

      "\n",
      "The former student who shot through the doors of a Nashville Christian elementary school in March and killed three children and three adults died from gunshot wounds to the head, torso and other parts of the body, an autopsy report released Monday showed.Video above: Should you talk about school shootings with your kids?The autopsy said the manner of death of 28-year-old Audrey Hale was homicide. The report — released by the medical examiner in Davidson County, which encompasses Nashville — said Hale not only had gunshot wounds but also blunt force trauma throughout the body.Hale opened fire at the Covenant School on March 27 before being shot to death by officers.The release of the report comes as a growing collection of groups are embroiled in a complex legal battle over the release of Hale's writings and other documents in the police investigation. The Tennessean newspaper, a state senator, a law enforcement nonprofit and a gun-rights organization are advocating for the release of the records.Meanwhile, a group of Covenant School parents, the Covenant School and Covenant Presbyterian Church have been allowed to intervene to fight against the publication of the documents.On Monday, a Nashville judge declined to pause the court proceedings so that those seeking the records could wait on their appeal of a decision allowing the Covenant School parents to intervene in the case.Chancery Court Judge I'Ashea Myles stated that the Legislature intended for public records cases to be expedited and they are not supposed to take as long as other legal battles. She said that hitting pause on the case now would undermine that intent.Myle's decision comes just days after Nashville attorney David Raybin, who is representing Hale's parents, informed the judge that he was helping transfer ownership of the writings to the Covenant parents from Hales' parents. Supporters hope that the transfer of ownership will strengthen the argument that the Covenant parents have to stand to intervene and stop the release of Hale's writings.It is thought that the writings might reveal a motive for the attack.According to the autopsy report, Hale was wearing a white shirt with \"handwritten words, drawings and numbers written on it.\" The report did not detail what the writings said but noted handwritten words were also found on Hale's bra.Law enforcement has said Hale was transgender and also went by \"Aiden.\" The autopsy report said Hale was carrying a red pocket knife with the name \"AIDEN\" monogrammed on it.Police have said Hale planned the massacre for months. Hale, who fired 152 rounds during the attack, was under a doctor's care for an undisclosed \"emotional disorder,\" police said. However, authorities haven't disclosed a link between that care and the shooting.Killed in the attack were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old. The three adults killed were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, and custodian Mike Hill and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, who were 61.\n"

      "The results reflect Americans’ increasing support of LGBTQ rights and protections, in sharp contrast to a growing wave of legislation and legal action nationwide chipping away at such rights and protections.\n",

      "Chris Erchull, attorney for GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), said the findings show most Americans believe in treating each other fairly.\n",

      "“This poll shows that the current campaign of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and efforts to weaken existing nondiscrimination protections is out of step with what the majority of Americans want,\" Erchull said. \".... Targeting one community with harmful legislation is not a winning political strategy long-term and runs contrary to core principles in our democracy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar sentiments were expressed by Christy Mallory, legal director for the Williams Institute and one of the study's authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Recent efforts by some state legislatures to expand religious exemptions from LGBTQ-inclusive non-discrimination laws are largely out of alignment with the views of most Americans,” she said in a release accompanying the findings.\n",

      "A record number of anti-LGBTQ bills\n",
      "\n",
      "As of May 23, the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights group, had tallied a record 520 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in legislatures this year, with more than 40% of those targeting transgender and nonbinary people. More than 125 bills would ban transgender youth from accessing gender-affirming care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a recent report found the number of LGBTQ-hostile states on the rise, reflecting the growing amount of legislation targeting gender-affirming care, reducing protections for transgender people, and limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n",

      "Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is expected to rule this year in the case of Colorado web designer Lorie Smith, who is asking the state not to compel her to create web pages for same-sex weddings, which she said conflict with her religious beliefs. LGBTQ advocates fear a decision in Smith's favor could have more far-reaching consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey findings were gleaned from a national poll of 1,003 U.S. adults conducted in September 2022 and commissioned by nonpartisan research firm NORC at the University of Chicago in partnership with the Williams Institute, a think tank dedicated to gender identity and sexual orientation research at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.\n",

      "More than 8 in 10 respondents (84%) opposed allowing medical professionals to cite religious beliefs as a reason to deny care to LGBTQ people, while 74% said they were against letting employers deny jobs to LGBTQ individuals. About 7 in 10 (71%) said they objected to business owners citing religious beliefs as a reason for denying LGBTQ people service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majorities were consistent across political affiliations, religions, race, ethnicity and gender, the poll found. Women, people of color and Democrats were most likely to say they opposed discrimination against LGBTQ people on religious grounds, including more than 80% of Black respondents.\n",

      "Democrats were far more likely (92%) than Republicans (71%) to oppose religious-based discrimination against LGBTQ individuals in terms of medical care, as well as business services (90% to 52%) and employment (89% to 54%).\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of gender differences, women were likelier (86%) than men (81%) to oppose religious-based discrimination by medical professionals, as well as by business owners (76% to 67%) and employers (79% to 69%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition to bias lowest among the most religious\n",
      "\n",
      "When broken down by religious attendance, those regularly frequenting religious services were least likely to oppose religious-based denial of such services to LGBTQ people, though those who did still represented a majority of the group. Just 53% of that category opposed religious-based discrimination against LGBTQ people on the part of business owners, while 59% opposed such bias from employers and 71% from medical providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition was highest among those who never attended services, with at least 8 in 10 among that group objecting to allowing religious-based discrimination by medical professionals (89%), employers (82%) and business owners (80%).\n",

      "The findings, the study authors said, should give pause to policymakers, business owners and service providers given the growing pattern of restrictions against LGBTQ people.\n",

      "While LGBTQ people are not explicitly protected from discrimination at the federal level, laws banning sex-based discrimination have been interpreted to extend to members of the LGBTQ community. Additionally, 33 states and the District of Columbia also provide discrimination protections in areas such as employment, housing and public accommodations.\n",

      "Hundreds of bills have been proposed this year restricting the rights of transgender people, and LGBTQ+ advocates say they've seen a record number of such measures in statehouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least 17 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and several other states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care. Proposed bans are also pending before Texas and Missouri's governors.\n",
      "\n",
      "These bans have spread quickly, with only three states enacting such laws before this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before DeSantis signed the latest ban, Florida was one of two states that had restricted the care via regulations or administrative action. Texas's governor has ordered child welfare officials to investigate reports of children receiving such care as child abuse, though a judge has blocked those investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three transgender youth and their parents who are suing to block Florida's earlier ban on the care for minors expanded their challenge on Wednesday to include the prohibition DeSantis signed into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans and supported the medical care for youth when administered appropriately. Lawsuits have been filed in several of the states where the bans have been enacted this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "STATES POISED TO ACT\n",
      "\n",
      "A proposed ban on gender affirming care for minors is awaiting action before Republican Gov. Mike Parson in Missouri. The state’s Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, this week withdrew a rule he had proposed that would have gone further by also restricting access to the care for adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bailey cited the bill pending before Parson as a reason for eliminating the rule, which had been blocked by a state judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nebraska Republicans on Tuesday folded a 12-week abortion ban into a bill that would ban gender affirming care for minors, potentially clearing the way for a final vote on the combined measure as early as this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all states are adopting restrictions, and some Democrat-led states are enacting measures aimed at protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan Democrats plan to introduce legislation Thursday that would ban conversion therapy for minors, a discredited practice of trying to “convert” people to heterosexuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legislation is expected to move quickly with Democrats in control of all levels of state government. Democratic state Rep. Jason Hoskins, a sponsor of the bill, told The Associated Press that he hopes the legislation passes by the end of June, which is Pride Month.\n",

      "\n",
      "On “Varney & Co.” Friday, former CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder discussed Anheuser-Busch CEO Brandan Whitworth’s tepid message to customers addressing the company’s Bud Light controversy, arguing the CEO needs to either be “more definitive” or “get rid of the brand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "ANDY PUZDER: Look, the lesson here is it’s twofold. One is, don’t offend your target market. Now, I can’t believe I have to say that, but apparently I do have to say that at this point in the business climate, don’t offend your target market. And if you do offend them, come out quickly, rapidly and definitively and take back whatever you did. You can’t offend the people that create the market for your product and expect to do very well. And these half measures are not going to work. They’re just not going to work. He needs to be more definitive or he needs to, you know, get rid of the brand and come out with another brand that meets his customers’ needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitworth told customers “We hear you,” as sales of the beer giant’s Bud Light brand continue to slide following a partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney.\n",

      "Dylan Mulvaney, pictured here at the 2023 Now Awards in June is the center of the Bud Light controversy after her sponsored partnership with the company led to backlash and a sharp sales drop. MM/ABACA/Shutterstock\n",
      "\n",
      "In a post titled “Anheuser-Busch Announces Support For Frontline Employees And Wholesaler Partners,” Whitworth said, “We recognize that over the last two months, the discussion surrounding our company and Bud Light has moved away from beer, and this has impacted our consumers, our business partners, and our employees.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are a beer company, and beer is for everyone,” he continued.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Third, to all our valued consumers, we hear you. Our summer advertising launches next week, and you can look forward to Bud Light reinforcing what you’ve always loved about our brand – that it’s easy to drink and easy to enjoy,” Whitworth also said.\n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) – Two days after he was pulled from a main-stage appearance at this year’s Pride Celebration in San Francisco — and after his song, “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” was canceled as the festival’s unofficial rallying cry — Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider has issued a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was not aware the Transgender community expects fealty and total agreement with all their beliefs and any variation or deviation is considered ‘transphobic,'” wrote Snider in a Facebook post.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, my lifetime of supporting the Transgender community’s right to identify as they want and honoring whatever changes they may make in how they present themselves to the world isn’t enough?” he continued, in a post he titled, “So, I hear I’m transphobic. Really?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the center of the brouhaha with Pride is a tweet Snider sent earlier this week, in which he voiced his support for a statement from fellow rocker, Paul Stanley of Kiss, that was widely panned for being anti-trans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stanley’s post read, in part: “With many children who have no real sense of sexuality or sexual experiences caught up in the ‘fun’ of using pronouns and saying what they identify as, some adults mistakenly confuse teaching acceptance with normalizing and encouraging a situation that has been a struggle for those truly affected and have turned it into a sad and dangerous fad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The post led some to criticize the Kiss singer of mischaracterizing gender-affirming care as a “some sort of game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snider retweeted Stanley’s remarks, adding, “You know what? There was a time where I ‘felt pretty’ too. Glad my parents didn’t jump to any rash conclusions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet resulted in Pride dropping Snider from its main stage where he was set to perform Twisted Sister’s hard-rock anthem “We’re Not Gonna Take It.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dee has always been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights,” said SF Pride in a statement on the matter. “However, when we were notified about the tweet in which Dee expressed support for Kiss’s Paul Stanley’s transphobic statement, we were heartbroken and angry. The message perpetuated by that tweet casts doubt on young trans people’s ability to self-identify their gender.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his lengthy response to being dropped by Pride, Snider attempted to explain his viewpoint, saying, “I’ve recently stated I do not believe young children are ready to decide their gender allocation. I believe their choices should be supported and accepted by their parents, but I do not think kids have the mental capabilities to make rational, logical decisions on things of a magnitude that will affect them for the rest of their lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snider goes on to describe himself as a “proud moderate,” and a heterosexual who proudly supports LBGTQIA+ rights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The transgender community needs moderates who support their choices, even if we don’t agree with every one of their edicts,” Snider continued. “For some Transgender people (not all) to accuse supporters, like me, of transphobia is not a good look for their cause.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The singer, who signed off his statement as “Your cisgender, crossdressing ally,” said he would continue to support the transgender community and their right to choose, “even if they reject me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snider’s full statement can be read on Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kiss’ Paul Stanley, meanwhile, has since claimed the wording of his initial post was not “clear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most importantly and above all else, I support those struggling with their sexual identity while enduring constant hostility and those whose path leads them to reassignment surgery,” Stanley wrote Thursday on social media. “It’s hard to fathom the kind of conviction that one must feel to take those steps.”\n"
