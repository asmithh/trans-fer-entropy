      "TOPEKA, Kan. — Allowing transgender Kansas residents to intervene in a lawsuit that seeks to force the state to list the sex they were assigned at birth on their driver's licenses would create a legal “morass,” the state's Republican attorney general argued in a new court filing.\n",

Kobach wants to keep the focus of the case on his argument that a new state law that rolled back transgender rights as of July 1 bars the state from changing transgender people's driver's licenses to reflect their gender identities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kobach filed the lawsuit last month against two top officials in the Kansas Department of Revenue, which issues driver's licenses. The lawsuit came after Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly announced that people could continue to have their driver's licenses changed despite the new law, which defines male and female under any state law as the sex assigned to a person at birth. The Republican-controlled Legislature overrode Kelly's veto and enacted it.\n",

      "District Judge Theresa Watson has an Aug. 16 hearing set in Shawnee County, home to the state capital of Topeka, on the transgender people's request to intervene. Watson already has directed the department not to change transgender people's licenses while the lawsuit moves forward, and that order is to remain in place until at least Nov. 1. Kansas is among a few states that don't allow such changes, along with Montana, Oklahoma and Tennessee.\n",

      "The issue is in federal court because of a lawsuit filed in 2018 over a previous no-changes policy. Kelly's administration settled that lawsuit, and a judge's order enforcing the settlement requires the state to allow transgender people to alter their birth certificates. More than 900 people have done so over the past four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kobach last month asked a federal judge to lift the requirement — and make Kansas among only a few U.S. states that don't allow birth certificate changes. The original lawsuit named only three health department officials as defendants, so Kelly's office filed a request Wednesday for permission to file written “friend of the court” arguments. The judge has not yet ruled on Kelly's request.\n",

      "\n",
      "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A federal judge announced a long-awaited decision on whether Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren should be restored to office, ruling Friday that the ousted prosecutor cannot be reinstated, even though Gov. Ron DeSantis violated state law when he suspended him last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, DeSantis suspended Warren from Florida’s 13th Judicial Circuit, accusing him of neglect of duty after Warren signed pledges stating he would not enforce a new 15-week abortion law or prosecute providers of gender transition treatment for young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warren was one of a number of other state attorneys and prosecutors from around the country who signed the pledges. He filed a federal lawsuit later that month, accusing DeSantis of abusing his power over the suspension from office.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the three-day trial, which ended in early December, DeSantis’ lawyers argued Warren was removed due to his performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his order, Judge Robert Hinkle wrote that the governor had violated the Florida Constitution, but said the matter could not be resolved in the federal court’s jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The suspension also violated the Florida Constitution, and that violation did affect the outcome,” Hinkle wrote. “But the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In sum, the transgender and abortion statements—with the exception of the one sentence in the abortion statement—were protected by the First Amendment,” the order continued. “These other factors could not properly be the basis for a suspension under the Florida Constitution—there were no blanket non-prosecution policies, no neglect of duty, and no incompetence.”\n",
      "\n",

      "In the United States, the national conference of Catholic bishops rejects the concept of gender transition, leaving many transgender Catholics feeling excluded. On Wednesday, the Vatican made public a sharply contrasting statement, saying it’s permissible, under certain circumstances, for trans Catholics to be baptized and serve as godparents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a major step for trans inclusion … it is big and good news,” said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of Maryland-based New Ways Ministry, which advocates for greater LGBTQ acceptance in the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document was signed Oct. 21 by Pope Francis and Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, who heads the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. It was posted Wednesday on that office’s website.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it did not cause scandal or “disorientation” among other Catholics, a transgender person “may receive baptism under the same conditions as other faithful,” the document said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the document said trans adults — even if they had undergone gender-transition surgery — could serve as godfathers or godmothers under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeBernardo said this seemed to be a reversal of a 2015 Vatican decision to bar a trans man in Spain from becoming a godparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his papacy, Pope Francis has frequently expressed an interest in making the Catholic Church more welcoming to LGBTQ people, even though doctrines rejecting same-sex marriage and sexual activity remain firmly in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small but growing number of U.S. parishes have formed LGBTQ support groups and welcome transgender people on their own terms. Yet several Catholic dioceses have issued guidelines targeting trans people with restrictions and refusing to recognize their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In a statement released Monday, the Dodgers said, “After much thoughtful feedback from our diverse communities, honest conversations within the Los Angeles Dodgers organization and generous discussions with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the Los Angeles Dodgers would like to offer our sincerest apologies to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, members of the LGBTQ+ community and their friends and families.”\n",

      "In the United States, the national conference of Catholic bishops rejects the concept of gender transition, leaving many transgender Catholics feeling excluded. On Wednesday, the Vatican made public a sharply contrasting statement, saying it’s permissible, under certain circumstances, for trans people to be baptized as Catholics and serve as godparents.\n",

      "“It is a major step for trans inclusion … it is big and good news,” said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of Maryland-based New Ways Ministry, which advocates for greater LGBTQ acceptance in the church.\n",

      "If it did not cause scandal or “disorientation” among other Catholics, a transgender person “may receive baptism under the same conditions as other faithful,” the document said.\n",

      "Similarly, the document said trans adults — even if they had undergone gender-transition surgery — could serve as godfathers or godmothers under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeBernardo said this seemed to be a reversal of a 2015 Vatican decision to bar a trans man in Spain from becoming a godparent.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials released data Tuesday showing how chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis cases have been accelerating, but doctors are hoping an old drug will help fight the sexually transmitted infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts believe STDs have been rising because of declining condom use, inadequate sex education and reduced testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millions of Americans are infected each year. Rates are highest in men who have sex with men, and among Black and Hispanic Americans and Native Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sexually transmitted infections are an enormous, low-priority public health problem. And they’ve been a low-priority problem for decades, in spite of the fact that they are the most commonly reported kind of infectious disease,” said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., a retired health official who lectures at the Colorado School of Public Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "To try to turn the tide, many doctors see promise in doxycycline, a cheap antibiotic that has been sold for more than 50 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is drafting recommendations for using it as a kind of morning-after pill for preventing STDs, said Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the agency’s STD prevention division.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drug is already used to treat a range of infections. A study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine showed its potential to prevent sexually transmitted infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the study, about 500 gay men, bisexual men and transgender women in Seattle and San Francisco with previous STD infections took one doxycycline pill within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Those who took the pills were about 90% less likely to get chlamydia, about 80% less likely to get syphilis, and more than 50% less likely to get gonorrhea compared with people who did not take the pills after sex, the researchers found.\n",

I recently found out he has been working with a woman he was sleeping with while we were dating. They have been talking after work. Plus, he calls her when she is not at work. He said it’s just to say hello and check up on her. He deletes his call log but I still see the phone bill with all the calls. Of course he keeps his phone on vibrate.

      "Let me let you in on a relationship rule: If you ever find yourself scrutinizing call logs, it’s already over. Your husband is obviously being unfaithful to you, definitely emotionally and probably physically too. You should tell him that you are aware of this. Not that you have questions about his phone calls, or that you think his relationship with his ex is suspicious, but that you are aware of what he’s doing because he’s not even conscientious enough to hide it well, and you want to offer him an opportunity to stop and rebuild trust with you or separate. Thirty-five years is a long time, so I suppose you should check all the boxes by dragging him kicking and screaming to couples therapy as a condition of staying married. It’s worth a try! Worst case scenario, it could serve as a place for you to talk about how you’ll navigate your relationship with your grown children and how to handle it when, one day in the future, he wants to bring his “friend” as his date to one of their weddings.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have referred to dignity twice now. That is intentional. Outside of certain select phrases (“the dignity of labor”), we don’t talk much about dignity in American politics, despite the fact that the demands of many groups for dignity and respect in public life have been a driving force in American history since the beginning. To that point, one of the great theorists of dignity and democracy in the United States was none other than Frederick Douglass, whose experience in bondage gave him a lifelong preoccupation with the ways that dignity is either cultivated or denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglass observed “that although dignity seems to be woven into human nature, it is also something one possesses to the degree that one is conscious of having it,” the historian Nicholas Knowles Bromell writes in “The Powers of Dignity: The Black Political Philosophy of Frederick Douglass,” “and one’s own consciousness of having it depends in part on making others conscious of it. Others’ recognition of it then flows back and confirms one’s belief in having it, but conversely their refusal to recognize it has the opposite effect of weakening one’s confidence in one’s own dignity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is easy to see how this relates to chattel slavery, a totalizing system in which enslaved Black Americans struggled to assert their dignity and self-respect in the face of a political, social and economic order that sought to rob them of both. But Douglass explored this idea in other contexts as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing after the Civil War on women’s suffrage, Douglass asked his readers to see the “plain” fact that “women themselves are divested of a large measure of their natural dignity by their exclusion from and participation in Government.” To “deny woman her vote,” Douglass continued, “is to abridge her natural and social power, and to deprive her of a certain measure of respect.” A woman, he concluded, “loses in her own estimation by her enforced exclusion from the elective f.........\n",

      "\n",
      "You might reasonably ask: What menace? After all, the Soviet Union fell apart more than 30 years ago and, long before that, communist parties around the world had dwindled in numbers and lost their revolutionary zeal. The American Communist Party was buried alive nearly three-quarters of a century ago during the McCarthy hysteria of the 1950s.\n",
      "\n",
      "How then can there be a muscular rebirth of anti-communism when there’s no communism to face off against? The Claremont Institute, a right-wing think tank, explains the paradox this way: the powers that be of the present moment, including “education, corporate media, entertainment, big business, especially big tech, are to varying degrees aligned with the Democratic Party which is now controlled by Woke Communism.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All clear now? A “cold civil war” is afoot, so we’re assured by DeSantis and crew, and if we don’t act quickly, “woke communism will replace American justice… the choice is between liberty or death.”\n",

      "Naturally, Donald Trump has joined the chorus, declaiming that the Democratic Party functions as a cover for “wild-eyed Marxists.” People like Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, formerly considered proud defenders of capitalism, are now censored as socialists.

      "\n",
      "“In 2016, I declared I am your voice,” Trump said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference and repeated at his first 2024 campaign rally in Waco, Texas. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we describe what Trump wants for America? “Authoritarianism” isn’t adequate. It is “fascism.” Fascism stands for a coherent set of ideas different from — and more dangerous than — authoritarianism. To fight those ideas, it’s necessary to be aware of what they are and how they fit together.\n",

      "\n",
      "Indiana’s governor signed a bill banning all gender-affirming care for minors Wednesday, joining at least 12 other states, like Kentucky, that have enacted laws restricting or banning such care.Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed the legislation after Republican majorities in the Legislature approved it. The law will go into effect July 1, and trans youth currently taking medication to transition would have until the end of the year to stop doing so.Holcomb told reporters Tuesday that the bill on his desk was vague and had not indicated he would sign it or veto it.Opponents of the legislation said the types of care the bill would ban, such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers, are vital and often life-saving for transgender kids. Medical providers say most of the procedures banned in the bill are reversible and safe for minors. Transgender medical treatments for children and teens have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations.But supporters of the legislation have contended such care is not reversible or carries side effects that only an adult — and not a minor’s parent — can consent to.Lawmakers also banned gender-transition surgeries for minors in the state, though hospital representatives in Indiana told lawmakers doctors do not perform genital surgeries for minors or provide them surgery referrals.At least 12 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.\n",

      "That treatment typically begins with puberty-blocking medication to temporarily pause sexual development. The idea is to give youngsters time to mature enough mentally and emotionally to make informed decisions about whether to pursue permanent treatment. Puberty blockers may be used for years and can increase risks for bone density loss, but that reverses when the drugs are stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sex hormones — estrogen or testosterone — are offered next. Dutch research suggests that most gender-questioning youth on puberty blockers eventually choose to use these medications, which can produce permanent physical changes. So does transgender surgery, including breast removal or augmentation, which sometimes is offered during the mid-teen years but more typically not until age 18 or later.\n",

      "In sections of the major health institute’s guidance on breastfeeding, it contained information for those who have had much of their breasts removed in gender-reassignment surgeries, or for biological men taking hormones to grow breasts, on how to feed their newborn children.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, several doctors criticized the guidance, not simply because CDC has appeared to guide biological men in how to breastfeed children, but because they claimed the CDC has failed to gauge the risks posed to children drinking milk produced by chemicals used in gender-reassignment medical operations.\n",

      "Puberty delaying treatment along with hormonal and surgical gender affirmation treatments for minors require more research, “a thorough examination before treatment,” explanation of benefits, effects, possible risks, side effects, and a close follow-up, said Ukom, a health care investigator based in Norway that provides related recommendations to the Norwegian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on data collected by the organization, the national guidelines for gender incongruence, which were established in 2020, leave “room for different interpretations,” and hence, need to be reviewed and updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "More data needs to be collected to be able to make informed decisions, and there must be a systematic collection of such data for quality research. Ukom has also recommended setting up a national medical register for providing an overview of gender treatments and their effects.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost three weeks after Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a bill making it a felony for doctors to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors, a judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the law for three children whose parents are part of an ongoing lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florida is one of at least 20 states that have limited gender-affirming treatment for minors. The legislators sponsoring some of these bills say their intent is to protect children and families from pressure “to receive harmful, experimental puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones and to undergo irreversible, life-altering surgical procedures,” as a new Montana law puts it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gender transitions involving major surgeries not only result in sterility, but other irreversible negative biological effects,” said Montana state Sen. John Fuller, the Republican who introduced the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such laws and policies, and statements — such as Fuller’s — used to justify them, reflect misconceptions and misinformation that conflate treatments and strip trans youth of essential care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gender-affirming care is a broad term for many distinct treatments provided to children, teens, and adults.

      "The only HIV vaccine in a late-stage trial has failed, researchers announced Wednesday, dealing a significant blow to the effort to control the global HIV epidemic and adding to a decadeslong roster of failed attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known as Mosaico, the trial was the product of a public-private partnership including the United States government and the pharmaceutical giant Janssen. It was run out of eight nations in Europe and the Americas, including the U.S., starting in 2019. Researchers enrolled nearly 3,900 men who have sex with men and transgender people, all deemed at substantial risk of HIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leaders of the study decided to discontinue the mammoth research effort after an independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the trial’s findings and saw no evidence the vaccine lowered participants’ rate of HIV acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s obviously disappointing,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, who as the long-time head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was an integral partner in the trial, said of the vaccine’s failure. However, he said, “there are a lot of other approaches” early in the HIV-vaccine research pipeline that he finds promising.\n",
