      "In the present study, we used the adenine-induced CKD mouse model which can mimic most of renal structural and functional changes in human CKD and require no surgery or genetic manipulation [27, 28]. To explore whether PXR plays a protective role in CKD, we constructed the adenine-induced CKD model in C57BL/6J mice and treated CKD mice with or without PCN, a specific exogenous agonist of mouse PXR, for 4 weeks [29]. The mice were divided into 4 groups: (i) Ctrl (mice were fed with normal diet), (ii) PCN (mice were fed with normal diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week), (iii) AD (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet), and (iv) AD + PCN (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week) (Fig. 1a) [30]. Compared with the Ctrl mice, adenine treatment resulted in a significant reduce in body size, granular changes on the surface of the kidneys, and a marked increase in the levels of serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24-h urinary albumin excretion, all of which was improved by PCN treatment (Fig. 1b–e). In addition, consistent with previous studies, the adenine diet led to a sharp decrease in body weight, kidney weight and urine osmolality (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b and f), a significant increase in relative kidney weight (the ratio of kidney weight to body weight), 24-h water intake and urine output in mice (Supplementary Fig. S1c–e) [24, 31]. To assess the effect of PCN on renal structural damage induced by adenine diet, we visualized paraffin sections with H&E staining and scored the renal tubulointerstitial (TI) damage (Fig. 1f, g). Mice in the Ctrl and PCN groups showed normal renal morphology, while mice in the AD group exhibited various renal structural damages, including renal tubular atroph.........\n",

      "\n",
      "First, we used the Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) database to investigate the level of USP13 transcript in different tumor tissues and found that USP13 was up-regulated in most of the digestive system neoplasms, including GC (Fig. 1A). The data from GEO dataset (GSE27342) also exhibited the up-regulation of USP13 in GC tissues (Fig. 1B). Then we analyzed the expression of USP13 in different GC grades and subtypes. The results indicated that the expression of USP13 was positively associated with the tumor grades (Fig. 1C). And compared to normal, the expression of USP13 was significantly increased in four different GC subtypes, with the highest average expression value in the EBV (epstein–barr virus) subtype and the lowest expression in the GS (genomically stable) subtype (Fig. 1D). We further used western blot to determine the protein level of USP13 in 32 pairs of GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues and found that the protein level of USP13 was elevated in 65.6% (21/32) of the GC tissues (Fig. 1E). We used ImageJ software to quantify the protein bands and statistically analyzed the data with paired t-test. The results showed that the protein level of USP13 was significantly increased in GC tissues (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1F). Additionally, we used Kaplan–Meier Plotter database to analyze the correlation between USP13 exprsssion and the overall survival (OS) of GC patients. Since the dataset GSE62254 in Kaplan–Meier Plotter database contains markedly different characteristics from all other datasets, we excluded GSE62254 from pooled analysis and analyzed GSE62254 separately. The results from three different Affymetrix probes (205356_at, 227788_at, 226902_at) showed similar trends that higher expression of USP13 in GC tissues resulted in shorter overall survival (OS) of GC patients both in the pooled analysis excludi.........\n",

      "\n",
      "A previous study has demonstrated that SE-associated protein-coding genes were characterized in integrative analysis of both sensitivities to transcriptional inhibition and their expression levels in glioma cells [19]. To investigate the implications of SE-associated lncRNAs in glioma, the publicly available H3K27Ac and MED1 ChIP-seq datasets of glioblastoma (GBM) cells were obtained and analyzed to generate a catalog of SEs (Fig. 1A, B). We identified 256 and 197 SE-associated lncRNAs upon occupancy of either H3K27Ac or MED1, respectively (Fig. 1C). Importantly, 176 SE-associated lncRNAs were overlapped (Fig. 1C). To prioritize these SE-associated lncRNAs for further study, we selected lncRNAs with (1) elevated expression in GBM tissue versus low-grade glioma (LGG) tissue (Fig. 1D, E) and (2) prognostic significance from the integrated analysis CGGA and TCGA databases, where high lncRNA expression was associated with poor glioma patient survival (Fig. 1F). A total of nine differentially expressed SE-lncRNAs were selected for further analyses (Fig. 1F). To validate data, we analyzed nine candidates’ SE-lncRNAs expression in the GEPIA database. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A–F, LUCAT1, LINC00601, LOXL1-AS1, SBF2-AS1, PINK1-AS, and NEAT1 were observed with no significant differences in glioma compared to normal tissues. PVT1 and DLGAP1-AS2 were highly expressed in GBM but not LGG compared to normal brain tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1G–H). Notably, only LIMD1-AS1 was finally found to be significantly overexpressed in GBM and LGG, but in other types of cancer, suggesting that LIMD1-AS1 may be mainly involved in the progression of glioma (Supplementary Fig. 1I).\n",

The same catalyst was characterized in our previous work by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; and X-ray diffraction to ensure phase purity and bimetallic composition11. Figure 1a shows three measurements of the apparent activation energy (64.3 ± 2.3 kJ mol−1) of ethylene hydrogenation over Pd 9 Zn 43 . We attribute the different intercepts among these measurements to small changes in the number of exposed surface sites amongst the three catalyst beds. Temperature-dependent reaction orders in hydrogen and ethylene were measured over Pd 9 Zn 43 (Fig. 1b). Reaction order data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. At 318 K, the hydrogen order is 0.80, while the ethylene order is −0.26. As temperature increases, the order in hydrogen decreases, while the order in ethylene becomes less negative and even positive at the highest temperatures examined. The sharp dependence in reaction orders with temperature suggests changes in surface coverage and potentially rate-determining steps, providing rich information for DFT-MKM analysis.\n",

The H-MTR has a typical structure of bottom-gate, top-contact flash memory transistor, except that the FG is located only under the drain electrode area. This drain-aligned FG reflects the operating condition of the H-MTR, where a contact electrode on the p-type single layer serves as the source and a contact electrode on the p-type/n-type double layer serves as the drain, in which case holes are injected from the source to the p-type semiconductor while electrons are injected from drain to the n-type semiconductor32. Therefore, the drain-aligned FG can control the amount of electron injection from the drain to the channel according to its memory state, while let the amount of hole injection from the source to the channel not perturbed. For blocking dielectric layer (BDL) and tunneling dielectric layer (TDL), poly(2-cyanoethyl acrylate-co-diethylene glycol divinyl ether) [p(CEA-co-DEGDVE)] (named pCD) and poly(1,3,5-trivinyl-1,3,5-trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3) were employed, respectively, both of which were deposited by a vapor-phase polymer deposition process, termed initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD)53,54,55. The thickness of the pCD BDL and the pV3D3 TDL was 70 and 15 nm respectively, yielding capacitance per unit area (C i ) of ≈62 nF cm−2 for BDL and ≈123 nF cm−2 for TDL (Supplementary Fig. 1). Such ultrathin dielectric layers allow for the low-power operation of the H-MTR56. Note that the pCD BDL is high-k dielectric (k > 5)57 while the pV3D3 TDL is low-k dielectric (k ~ 2.2)58, which is advantageous for non-volatile memory with high gate coupling ratio59. This enables a higher electric field (E) to be applied mostly across the TDL than the BDL during the programming operation, facilitating the Fowler-Nordheim (F-N)-like tunneling throu.........\n",

      "The experimental adsorption isotherm of water in NU-1500-Cr (Fig. 1A) slowly increases up to ~33% RH where it exhibits a sharp step that effectively ends at ~37% RH, after which it only shows a moderate increase up to ~70% RH. It should be noted that the adsorption isotherm shown in Fig. 1A slightly differs from the adsorption isotherm reported in ref. 18. The difference is due to the use of an incorrect value of the saturated vapor pressure of water at 298 K in the original study, which results to the original adsorption isotherm being shifted to slightly higher RH values relative the adsorption isotherm measured in the present study. To gain insights into the confining effects of the framework on the properties of water adsorbed in the pores, the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH ads ) and water entropy (S wat ) calculated from MD simulations carried out as a function of RH are shown in Fig. 1B, C respectively. ΔH ads becomes progressively more negative, indicating stronger framework–water interactions, as the RH increases and plateaus at a value of ~ − 14.5 kcal/mol between 15% and 31% RH. After this point, ΔH ads rapidly increases to a value of ~ − 12.5 kcal/mol in correspondence of the step in the adsorption isotherm between ~33% and ~37% RH and remains approximately constant at higher RH. At the lowest RH, the calculated enthalpy of adsorption is −13.4 kcal/mol, which is in a good agreement with the experimental values extracted from measurements of water adsorption in other MOFs using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation10,13,36,37. The decrease in ΔH ads observed from 1.8% to 31% RH can be attributed to both the development of hydrogen bonds among water molecules and framework–water interactions. Since the hydrogen-bond network becomes more extended as the RH increases, the increase in enthalpy in correspondence of the adsorption step (i.e.~33% and ~37%) suggests that fr.........\n",

As shown in Fig. 2a, the second phases of the SW33 alloy are small with size around 1 to several micrometers and discretely distributed. Figure 2b shows that the increasing Y addition in SW33 alloy can promote the precipitation of second phases and some light-gray-shadow regions rich of Y around the second phases were presented. These regions connect the second phases by forming a network structure. Figure 2c shows that the increasing Sr addition can more effectively facilitate the formation of intermetallic phases which are continuous along the grains’ boundaries. In addition, the EDS results, as shown in Fig. 2a 2 –c 2 , indicate that the Y has a certain solubility in α-Mg phase (point 4) and substitution in Mg 17 Sr 2 phase (point 1 and point 2) in the cast alloys.

      "\n",
      "As it is discussed in the methods section, the two components of our deep learning framework were to be first trained separately before evaluating the performance of our deep learning framework in designing NPN membranes with improved or prescribed strength values. In the first step, we train the CNN component of our deep learning framework on the training dataset for several epochs with batch size of 64 while its performance is evaluated on the validation dataset as is explained in the methods section. The learning curve of the training process for 50 epochs is shown in Fig. 2(a). From the figure, it is seen that the loss value of the training dataset defined based on the mean square error (MSE) drops in the first 15 epochs after which it reaches a plateau. Interestingly, the loss value of the validation dataset shows a similar trend with a minimum value at epoch of 13. The early stopping technique48,49 is used to verify that the CNN component starts to over-fit during the training process beyond epoch of 13. Our analysis confirms that epoch of 13 is the first epoch wherein the value of the model’s loss on the validation dataset does not improve for ten epochs. This indicates that the CNN has possibly learned the salient features of the labeled NPN images during the training process at this epoch. To better quantify the performance of the CNN component at this epoch, ground-truth strength values of the testing dataset obtained from FE simulations are plotted versus the predicted strength values obtained from the CNN network in Fig. 2(b) as the ‘parity plot’. From the figure, it is seen that the CNN predicts the strength of the NPN membranes with good accuracy as most of the points lie very close to the diagonal y = x line. This indicates that the CNN component has successfully learned the salient features .........\n",

      "Jeff Gennette, CEO of Macy’s, another major Pride sponsor, told The Associated Press that although the company has received some negative reactions to its Pride merchandise, the company is “very careful about how we put out this product that we select and how we position it on website and in stores” and doesn’t plan to remove any of it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The p38 MAPK family was first identified in studies of endotoxin-induced cytokine expression [11]. P38 is involved in inflammation, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell death, and the cell cycle [12]. There are four p38 isoforms including p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (SAPK3, ERK6 orMAPK12), and p38δ (MAPK13) with an overall sequence homology >60% and an identity within the kinase domains >90% [13]. The four p38 MAPK isoforms are ubiquitously expressed with different levels of expression in various tissues (Fig. 1). For example p38α is expressed in all cell types and tissues; p38β is predominant in the brain; p38γ is found in skeletal muscle and p38δ is mainly expressed in the testis, pancreas, kidney and small intestine [14]. Despite the high level of sequence homology of the four isoforms, they interact with different downstream effectors such as: MK2 (MAPK-activating protein kinase 2), PRAK (p38-related/activated protein kinase), ATF-2 (activating transcription factor-2), MEF2 (myocyte enhancement factor 2) and c-Jun and upstream MAPK kinase activators (including MKK4, MKK3 and MKK6) [15]. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK can activate a wide range of stimuli, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, cytoplasmic substrates and nuclear substrates [16]. The downstream events of these p-p38 MAPK have cell-specific consequences including regulation of RNA splicing, cytokine production, inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and cell differentiation [16]. Activated p38α has been shown to downregulate cyclins, upregulate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, modulate the tumor suppressor p53 at the G1/S and the G2/M phases and induce apoptosis. This reduces cell proliferation in primary cells (cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells, and airway epithelium). In contrast, p38α has also been shown to support cell survival via anti-apoptotic inflammatory signals interleukin-6 (IL-6) and en.........\n",

      "In the present study, we used the adenine-induced CKD mouse model which can mimic most of renal structural and functional changes in human CKD and require no surgery or genetic manipulation [27, 28]. To explore whether PXR plays a protective role in CKD, we constructed the adenine-induced CKD model in C57BL/6J mice and treated CKD mice with or without PCN, a specific exogenous agonist of mouse PXR, for 4 weeks [29]. The mice were divided into 4 groups: (i) Ctrl (mice were fed with normal diet), (ii) PCN (mice were fed with normal diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week), (iii) AD (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet), and (iv) AD + PCN (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week) (Fig. 1a) [30]. Compared with the Ctrl mice, adenine treatment resulted in a significant reduce in body size, granular changes on the surface of the kidneys, and a marked increase in the levels of serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24-h urinary albumin excretion, all of which was improved by PCN treatment (Fig. 1b–e). In addition, consistent with previous studies, the adenine diet led to a sharp decrease in body weight, kidney weight and urine osmolality (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b and f), a significant increase in relative kidney weight (the ratio of kidney weight to body weight), 24-h water intake and urine output in mice (Supplementary Fig. S1c–e) [24, 31]. To assess the effect of PCN on renal structural damage induced by adenine diet, we visualized paraffin sections with H&E staining and scored the renal tubulointerstitial (TI) damage (Fig. 1f, g). Mice in the Ctrl and PCN groups showed normal renal morphology, while mice in the AD group exhibited various renal structural damages, including renal tubular atroph.........\n",

      "An important feature of tumor sEVs is their capability in inhibiting anti-tumor immunity [47]. Strong data highlights that tumor sEVs carry a wide range of molecular cargos that are implicated in tumor-immune evasion [47, 48]. Of note, more recently the importance of TGF-β carried in sEVs in subverting immune responses has widely been considered, as discussed in the following sections.\n",

      "sEV-TGF-β inhibits NK cells cytolytic activity\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural killer cells are the first sentinels of the immune system against malignant cells, expressing a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors that determine their fate [49]. Under a hemostatic state, NK cells are tightly regulated by inhibitory receptors, and their ligands are normally expressed in non-tumor cells [49]. However, after malignant transformation, tumorous cells express several molecules that can be recognized by activating receptors on NK cells, leading to their immediate activation and cytolytic activity [49]. Undergoing rapid microevolution, tumor cells acquire several functionalities to suppress the function of NK cells, enabling them to evade the immune system [50]. Recent discoveries have established tumor cell-derived sEVs as important players in NK cell dysfunction [4]. Several sEV-associated biomolecules including proteins, lipids, miRNAs, and lncRNAs have been recognized so far to abolish the anti-tumor responses of immune cells, including NK cells [4]. Of note, TGF-β is a well-known inhibitor of NK cells and its serum levels among cancerous patients were confirmed to be strongly correlated with the status of NK cell dysfunction [51,52,53]. Clinical data show that tumor-derived TGF-β is associated with NKG2D downregulation on NK, NKT, CD8+, and γδT cells, whose aberrant loss in cancer is a key mechanism of immune evasion [54]. Similarly, TGF-β carried in sEVs emanating from tumors was shown to abolish NK cell responses via NKG.........\n",

      "The TME is a complex milieu that surrounds tumor cells, often providing immunosuppressive cover that facilitates immune invasion. Specifically, competition for nutrients or cell-intrinsic programming between cancer cells and immune cells induces nutrient deficiency and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, leading to modulation of antitumor immunity128,129. Given that activation and differentiation of immune cells are coupled to metabolic reprogramming, regulating the metabolic activity of immune cells should be considered in the development of potential strategies that target glutamine metabolism130,131.\n",

      "Glutamine metabolism in immune cells\n",
      "\n",
      "Accumulating evidence shows that glutamine is an immunomodulatory nutrient in immune cells. Naïve T cells are metabolically quiescent, undergoing basal levels of glycolysis and glutaminolysis sufficient to maintain minimal biosynthesis; however, T-cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated activation increases the expression of the Myc transcription factor, glutamine transporters (SLC38A1, SLC38A2), and glutaminolysis-related enzymes (GLS, GLUD1, GOT, GPT) to meet bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements, resulting in T-cell proliferation130,131,132,133. TCR-induced activation of mTORC1 and metabolic signaling pathways requires SLC1A5-dependent uptake of glutamine; indeed, an SLC1A5-deficient mouse model shows decreased induction of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells but not Th2, regulatory T (Treg), or CD8(+) T cells, leading to a decrease in proinflammatory T-cell responses134. Recent studies have shown that glutamine-derived α-KG regulates the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th1-type effector T cells or Treg cells via DNA methylation and lipid homeostasis135,136.

Not necessarily when they told you they were separating, but the moment where it really hit you, and you realized, my life is different, and it’s always going to be different? Tell us about your moment of realization and find all the submission details by visiting nytimes.com/divorcedparents. That link is also in our show notes. We can’t wait to hear from you. [MUSIC PLAYING] From The New York Times, I’m Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. When I was dating, I felt like people were always telling me to have fun. And, frankly, that ticked me off because I was like, this is not fun at all. I’m constantly confused, wondering if the person likes me, not sure if we want the same thing, terrified they’re ghosting me. Like, what is fun about that? Today’s essay is by Denny Agassi. Denny managed to do what I never could. She was actually having fun dating.

      "Indiana’s governor signed a bill banning all gender-affirming care for minors Wednesday, joining at least 12 other states, like Kentucky, that have enacted laws restricting or banning such care.Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed the legislation after Republican majorities in the Legislature approved it. The law will go into effect July 1, and trans youth currently taking medication to transition would have until the end of the year to stop doing so.Holcomb told reporters Tuesday that the bill on his desk was vague and had not indicated he would sign it or veto it.Opponents of the legislation said the types of care the bill would ban, such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers, are vital and often life-saving for transgender kids. Medical providers say most of the procedures banned in the bill are reversible and safe for minors. Transgender medical treatments for children and teens have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations.But supporters of the legislation have contended such care is not reversible or carries side effects that only an adult — and not a minor’s parent — can consent to.Lawmakers also banned gender-transition surgeries for minors in the state, though hospital representatives in Indiana told lawmakers doctors do not perform genital surgeries for minors or provide them surgery referrals.At least 12 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.\n",

We applied the 2D-SFS method to 1KGP populations to detect signals of positive selection on the C-C-A and C-A-G haplotypes (Tables 1, 2 and Supplimentary Table 2), considering that selection target haplotype(s) is different between JPT and CHB and those signals are not detected with haplotype-based tests (Supplimentary Fig. 1 and Iwasaki et al. 2020).\n",

      "Cross-modal autoencoder framework enables the integration of cardiovascular data modalities\n",
      "\n",
      "To build a cross-modal representation of the cardiovascular state, we utilize autoencoders to map paired cardiovascular data modalities, i.e. 38,686 paired median 12-lead ECGs and 50 frame videos of long-axis cardiac MRIs, from the UK Biobank1 into a common latent space. A description of the data used in this work is provided in the “Methods” subsection “Study design”. Building on the traditional autoencoder framework, we train modality-specific encoders and decoders to map to and from this latent space such that the reconstructed training examples are similar to the original examples for all modalities (see Fig. 1a). Additionally, given an ECG and MRI pair for a single individual, we utilize a loss function that ensures that paired ECG and MRI samples are represented via nearby points in the latent space (i.e., using a contrastive loss). Importantly, while our model is trained on paired modalities, the model can be applied in settings where only one modality is present. Namely, we simply utilize the embedding given by the trained encoder for the single input modality. A description of our loss function, architecture, and training procedures is given in the “Methods” subsection “Cross-modal autoencoder architecture and training details” and Supplementary Fig. S1. As indicated in Fig. 1, the resulting representations are useful for a variety of downstream tasks including phenotype prediction, modality translation, and genetic discovery. While we mainly apply our framework to integrate two modalities (ECGs and cardiac MRIs), we demonstrate that it can also be applied to three or more modalities in Supplementary Fig. S2.\n",

      "\n",
      "The USPSTF, a group of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctors' decisions and influence insurance plans, released the proposed update to its breast cancer screening guidance Tuesday. The recommendation is not final but will be available on the task force website for public comment through June 5, along with a draft evidence review and draft modeling report.\n",

      "The draft recommendation is for all people assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, trans men and nonbinary people, who are at average risk for breast cancer.\n",

      "Nicholson said that women with dense breasts and those with a family history of cancer generally fall into this category but not women who have a personal history of breast cancer or a family history of genetic mutations, like mutations on the BRCA gene, as they are considered to be at high risk.\n",

      "\n",
      "Neoliberal capitalism comes under scathing and thought-provoking artistic critique by renowned Spanish artist Isaac Cordal in his politically engaged new exhibition, “Smoke Signals,” which includes miniature sculptures, photography and diverse installations. Cordal uses his miniature statuettes to refigure space, fragment time, point to larger social issues and stand as imperfect constructions of a social order rooted in a mix of absurdity and oppression. Cordal’s sculptures inhabit those abandoned spaces that need to be reclaimed, reimagined and understood as sites of social and political change. In this exhibition, his art offers a searing critique of the capitalist notion of progress and its devastating assault on nature and the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smoke Signals,” which will appear June 8-18 at the MURAL Festival in Montreal, continues Cordal’s ongoing project of advocating for the democratization of public space and criticizing neoliberal capitalism while promoting a vision of community that enables open dialogue, shared notions of solidarity, and relations of mutual trust and compassion. Moreover, as Naomi Larsson observed in The Guardian, his art in its various expressions “represent a social stereotype as a critical observation on capitalism, power and bureaucracy.” In the photo essay included at the end of this piece, you can see for yourself some examples of how Cordal’s art challenges the brutality of neoliberal capitalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cordal, the public space is a site of vital struggle in confronting neoliberal capitalism’s death-driven machinery of misery, inequality, extermination and ecological assault.\n",

      "At the core of all authoritarian regimes is a politics of disappearance: a practice of elimination that targets the oppositional press, revolutionary ideas, perceived enemies, migrants, people of color, women and trans people, troubling knowledge and historical memories that threaten the existing racist capitalist order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the contemporary U.S., this authoritarian politics of disappearance manifests in new ways every week. In March 2023 alone, examples of this include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s efforts to remove discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation from all grades in Florida’s public school system. The American Library Association released a report indicating a sharp upsurge in the far right’s attempts to ban books and place restrictions on public libraries. The report stated that “2,571 unique titles were targeted for censorship, a 38% increase from the 1,858 unique titles targeted for censorship in 2021,” adding, “of those titles, the vast majority were written by or about members of the LGBTQIA+ community and people of color.”\n",

      "Librarians are increasingly the subject of online harassment, fear for their jobs, and “feel scared.” Across the country, Republican politicians are removing protections provided by child labor laws in a move likely to “put kids in dangerous situations.” Moreover, LGBTQ children and their caregivers are under attack, and spaces where they can exist without fear are disappearing as a result of the ongoing repressive assaults and gender-erasing policies produced by the GOP.

      "The long shadow of domestic fascism, defined as a project of racial and cultural cleansing, is with us once again both in North America and abroad. Educators have seen the ghosts of fascism before in acts of savage colonialism and dispossession, in an era of slavery marked by the brutality of whippings and neck irons, and in a Jim Crow age most obvious in the spectacularized horror of murderous lynchings. More recently we have viewed fascist acts of terror in a politics of disappearances and genocidal erasures under the dictatorships of Adolf Hitler, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and others. And in each case, history has given us a glimpse of what the end of humanity would look like.[1] Yet the lessons of history with its language of hate, machineries of torture, death camps and murderous violence as a political tool are too often ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "The promise and ideals of democracy are receding as right-wing extremists breathe new life into a fascist past. This is particularly true as education has increasingly become a tool of domination as right-wing pedagogical apparatuses controlled by the entrepreneurs of hate attack workers, the poor, people of color, trans people, immigrants from the south, and others considered disposable. Confronting this fascist counter-revolutionary movement necessitates creating a new language and the building of a mass social movement in order to construct empowering terrains of education, politics, justice, culture, and power that challenge existing systems of white supremacy, white nationalism, manufactured ignorance, civic illiteracy and economic oppression.\n",

      "The Supreme Court on Thursday used the case of a Christian mailman who didn't want to work Sundays to solidify protections for workers who ask for religious accommodations.In a unanimous decision the justices made clear that workers who ask for accommodations, such as taking the Sabbath off, should get them unless their employers show doing so would result in “substantial increased costs” to the business.The court made clear that businesses must cite more than minor costs — so-called “de minimis” costs — to reject requests for religious accommodations at work. Unlike most cases before the court, both sides in the case had agreed businesses needed to show more.The case before the court involved a mail carrier in rural Pennsylvania. The man was told that as part of his job, he’d need to start delivering Amazon packages on Sundays. He declined, saying his Sundays are for church and family. U.S. Postal Service officials initially tried to get substitutes for the man’s shifts, but they couldn’t always accommodate him. When he didn’t show, that meant more work for others. Ultimately, the man quit and sued for religious discrimination.The case is the latest religious confrontation the high court has been asked to referee. In recent years, the court’s 6-3 conservative majority has been particularly sensiti.........\n",

The reaction with NiCl 2 ·dme (where dme is dimethoxyethane) as the catalyst, L1 as the ligand, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) as the sacrificial donor, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as the electrolyte and graphite/Ni foam as the electrodes in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) with 4 mA current provided the desired product in 75% yield (entry 1). The use of N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA) instead of TMEDA as electrolyte decreased the yield dramatically (entry 2). Adjustment of the ratio of the substrates to 2:1:3 was not beneficial for the formation of the arylalkylation product (entry 3). Other electrode combinations were also tested. However, no good results were observed (entries 4–7). The application of other ligands led to lower yields (entries 8–11). The evaluation of nickel catalysts showed that NiBr 2 ·diglyme was the best candidate that delivered product 4a in 86% isolated yield (entries 12–15). The use of other electrolytes and reaction solvents did not improve the reaction outcome (entries 16–20). Increasing the current from 4 mA to 8 mA resulted in a lower yield (entry 21). The control experiments showed that all the reaction variables, including nickel catalyst, ligand, sacrificial amine donor, electrolyte and electricity, are essential for the high efficiency of this transformation (entries 22–26).\n",

In γ-ray polymerization of MMA (both in bulk and solution), we proposed that the polymerization of MMA proceeds in a radical polymerization-like manner, with simultaneous decomposition or branching of the resulting PMMA [34,35,36]. The detailed reaction mechanism is summarized in the SI. Compared to the original MMA/EGDMA content of ca. 6 g in MMT, 0.30 g and 0.24 g of polymer samples were obtained (i.e., their yields were 5% and 4%) at 15- and 60-h irradiation, respectively, after a series of operations (γ-irradiation, hydrofluoric acid treatment, reprecipitation, and freeze-drying). These samples are hereafter denoted as 2d-PMMA-γ15 and 2d-PMMA-γ60. Regarding the yield of PMMA in MMT obtained via γ-ray polymerization, Blumstein reported less than 10% even after sufficiently long irradiation [25]. The yields of the samples in our study (i.e., 4 ~ 5%) was slightly lower than that of the previous study (ca. 8% at the maximum) [25], but they were still comparable. The monomer conversion ratio was difficult to estimate from the γ-ray irradiated complexes prior to template decomposition and sample recovery operations. In our study, we performed γ-ray irradiation at room temperature, but increasing the temperature could increase the polymerization yield, as suggested in a previous study [37]. As discussed in detail later in the main text and SI, 2d-PMMA-γ15 had a higher fraction of the desired 2d-sheet-shaped polymers. This result was probably because the decomposition reaction occurred predominantly after a longer period of γ-ray irradiation for 2d-PMMA-γ60. Thus, the results for 2d-PMMA-γ15 are presented in the main text, while those for 2d-PMMA-γ60 are shown in the SI.\n",

      "Zirconia is an ionic material with a large phonon anharmonicity and it has been shown that zirconia doped with about 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 consists mainly of a meta-stable tetragonal phase at room temperature26,27. In this work, we used commercial partially stabilized zirconia ceramic plates (3.5 mol% Y 2 O 3 ) with a high volume-fraction of t-ZrO 2 . t-ZrO 2 becomes cubic (c-ZrO 2 ) at higher temperatures and can become monoclinic (m-ZrO 2 ) due to mechanical strain26,27,28. Figure 1a shows the crystal structures of ZrO 2 (different projections are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). The skeleton of the m-ZrO 2 lattice exhibits a shear distortion of 9° parallel to the basal plane of the unit cell of t-ZrO 2 26. Since the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is accompanied by a volume expansion, the microcracks that are normally caused by the deformation of a polycrystalline material, are suppressed via this stress-induced transformation of t-ZrO 2 26,27,28,29. Figure 1b shows the infrared reflection and Raman spectra of one the zirconia ceramic plates. Note that t-ZrO 2 has infrared phonon modes at 4.2 THz (T u ), 10.2 THz (A 2u ) and near 13 THz (T u )30. In this work, either the infrared phonon mode at 4.2 THz or that at 10.2 THz was excited resonantly by appropriately tuning the THz-FEL parameters (see Methods). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data of our sample are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.\n",

      "To elucidate the substitution effect on the thermodynamics of ROP of seven-membered lactones, a single-step Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclic ketones was exploited to construct a library of substituted caprolactones (M1−M7) on large scales (>10 g) with high yields (69−96%). M8 bearing a fused benzene ring was prepared by oxidative cyclization of 2,2’-(1,2-phenylene) diethanol in 82% yield on 8-gram scale. The polymerizability of M1−M8 was next investigated using a 1−2 mol% zinc catalyst [(BDI)ZnN(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] (Zn-1)88 in toluene-d 8 at an initial monomer concentration of 0.1−0.5 M (Fig. 2). Their thermodynamic data was acquired by monitoring the polymerization equilibrium changes over a temperature range of 40 to 70 °C by variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs. 108−115). Consequently, the standard-state thermodynamic parameters of ΔH p ° and ΔS p ° for ROP of M1−M8 were summarized in Table 1 and their T c values at 1 M were also calculated. Monosubstituted M1−M4 with the increase of steric hindrance from a methyl group to tert-butyl group displayed the ΔH p ° values of −16.2 ± 1.16, −14.0 ± 0.50, −14.8 ± 0.67, and −12.7 ± 0.75 kJ mol−1, respectively (Table 1, entries 2−5). Contrastingly, their ΔS p ° values showed an increasing tendency from −14.9 ± 3.58 to −24.7 ± 2.00 J mol−1 K−1. As a result, a significant decrease in the calculated T c values for M1−M4 at 1 M from 814 to 241 °C was observed in comparison with the previously reported T c value of 2060 °C for CL36. These data revealed that the alkyl substituent size has a powerful impact on polymerization thermodynamics. Beyond the substituent size, the substituent location appeared to have an important influence on polymerization thermodynamics as well.

      "We initiated the investigations of Pd-catalyzed hydrochlorocarbonylation with styrene 1a as the substrate at 80 °C in DCE under CO (Table 1). With Pd(PPh 3 ) 2 Cl 2 as the catalyst, the mixture of regioisomers of acid chlorides 2a/3a were indeed observed in 15% yield in the presence of HCl (entry 1). Unfortunately, due to the unavoidable hydrochlorination side-reaction initiated by HCl, the yield and regioselectivity of the reaction could not be improved after several attempts. We hypothesized that using in situ generated HCl might partially overcome the undesired hydrochlorination side reaction45. Therefore, a number of protocols for in situ formation of HCl have been examined in the reaction (entries 2–5)46. A 22% yield of acid chlorides 2a/3a were obtained with Ph 2 tBuSiCl/EtOH as the HCl source (entry 5). Nevertheless, the drawback of this Ph 2 tBuSiCl/EtOH reagent is of the accompanied hydroethanoxycarbonylation side reaction caused by EtOH. To this end, the Ph 2 tBuSiCl/AcOH reagent was found to be the best choice for hydrochlorocarbonylation, afford acid chlorides 2a/3a in 39% yields (entry 6).\n",

In this context, the sterically bulky PtBu 3 showed the highest efficiency for the formation of the branched acid chloride 2a, thus offering the optimal conditions for branched selective hydrochlorocarbonylation of alkenes (entry 11).
