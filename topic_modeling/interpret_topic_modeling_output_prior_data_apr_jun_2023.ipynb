In this section we focus on the Kβ main line region that comprises the stronger Kβ 1,3 peak around ~7058 eV and the weaker Kβ’ feature around ~7045 eV. Within the first ~300 fs, the Kβ main line difference spectrum indicates a shift of the pumped spectrum towards lower emission energies (Fig. 2a). This signal decays within a picosecond, revealing a longer-lived difference signal that reflects a shift towards higher energies. This longer-lived component partially decays within 1–5 ps, leaving a small residual that persists up to 40 ps, i.e., the upper time delay limit of our measurement. While subtle spectral reshaping may occur in the 1.5–40 ps range, these changes are not unambiguously resolved (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).\n",

      "We first describe the growth and the superconducting properties of the heavy-metal layer. We aimed at the preparation of ultrathin Au films, maintaining the surface structure of Nb(110) as it offers multiple distinct building directions for artificial chains, which enables some tuning of the hybridization of YSR states28,39,40 and, therefore, of the in-gap band structure of such chains25,26. An overview STM image of the Au/Nb(110) sample after the low-temperature deposition of Fe atoms is shown in Fig. 1a (preparation details in the Methods section). The Nb(110) surface is almost completely covered by one monolayer of Au (see sketch in Fig. 1a), with only a few remaining holes. Pseudomorphic growth, as predicted by LEED studies38, is confirmed by manipulated atom STM images41 (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1) of the first monolayer. Partially, the second monolayer Au has started to grow at step edges and in the form of a few free-standing islands (Fig. 1b). In this ultrathin limit, we find that the energy gap of the superconducting Nb is fully preserved in the monolayer Au due to the proximity effect, as demonstrated by the deconvoluted dI/dV spectrum (see Methods and Supplementary Note 2 for the deconvolution procedure) taken on the bare monolayer Au on Nb(110) far from any Fe atom in Fig. 1c (gray curve). The energy gap on the monolayer Au is of equal size as that of bare Nb(110) at our measurement temperature and the in-gap dI/dV signal is zero (see Supplementary Fig. 2). This behavior is crucial for our experiments, but might be altered for thicker films as indicated by recent theoretical42,43 and experimental44,45 studies.\n",

The same catalyst was characterized in our previous work by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; and X-ray diffraction to ensure phase purity and bimetallic composition11. Figure 1a shows three measurements of the apparent activation energy (64.3 ± 2.3 kJ mol−1) of ethylene hydrogenation over Pd 9 Zn 43 . We attribute the different intercepts among these measurements to small changes in the number of exposed surface sites amongst the three catalyst beds. Temperature-dependent reaction orders in hydrogen and ethylene were measured over Pd 9 Zn 43 (Fig. 1b). Reaction order data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. At 318 K, the hydrogen order is 0.80, while the ethylene order is −0.26. As temperature increases, the order in hydrogen decreases, while the order in ethylene becomes less negative and even positive at the highest temperatures examined. The sharp dependence in reaction orders with temperature suggests changes in surface coverage and potentially rate-determining steps, providing rich information for DFT-MKM analysis.\n",

      "In a recent work25 some of us presented a general approach based on high-throughput simulations of more than half a million zeolite-OSDA pairs and on the definition of new design metrics, which led to the phase-selective synthesis of targeted zeolites using newly identified OSDAs, and generated an online database called Organic Structure directing agent DataBase (OSDB) aimed to accelerate the design and optimization of OSDAs for selected zeolites. In this work, we used OSDB to select fifty zeolite structures that better stabilize the DPDMP+ cation (Fig. 1c), which is the OSDA mimicking the diaryl intermediates involved in aromatics transalkylation reactions18,24. To evaluate the influence of additional ethyl substituents in the aromatic rings on the stabilization by confinement of diaryl intermediates, the binding energy (BE) between each zeolite structure and the neutral diaryl intermediates for DEB-Bz transalkylation (I trans , Fig. 1c) and for DEB disproportionation (I disp , Fig. 1c) was evaluated using force fields (FF) as described in Methods Section. One organic molecule was introduced in each zeolite unit cell in different initial positions, and only the BE for the most stable location after optimization or each zeolite-intermediate pair are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and plotted in Supplementary Fig. 2. As expected, there is a clear correlation between BE I trans and BE OSDA values, which supports the transition state mimics approach for OSDAs selection and a slightly worse correlation between BE I disp and BE OSDA values due to the presence of additional ethyl groups in both aromatic rings. The plot of BE I disp versus BE I trans suggests that some zeolite structures might be able to discriminate between transalkylation and disproportionation intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 2b)..........\n",

      "The experimental adsorption isotherm of water in NU-1500-Cr (Fig. 1A) slowly increases up to ~33% RH where it exhibits a sharp step that effectively ends at ~37% RH, after which it only shows a moderate increase up to ~70% RH. It should be noted that the adsorption isotherm shown in Fig. 1A slightly differs from the adsorption isotherm reported in ref. 18. The difference is due to the use of an incorrect value of the saturated vapor pressure of water at 298 K in the original study, which results to the original adsorption isotherm being shifted to slightly higher RH values relative the adsorption isotherm measured in the present study. To gain insights into the confining effects of the framework on the properties of water adsorbed in the pores, the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH ads ) and water entropy (S wat ) calculated from MD simulations carried out as a function of RH are shown in Fig. 1B, C respectively. ΔH ads becomes progressively more negative, indicating stronger framework–water interactions, as the RH increases and plateaus at a value of ~ − 14.5 kcal/mol between 15% and 31% RH. After this point, ΔH ads rapidly increases to a value of ~ − 12.5 kcal/mol in correspondence of the step in the adsorption isotherm between ~33% and ~37% RH and remains approximately constant at higher RH. At the lowest RH, the calculated enthalpy of adsorption is −13.4 kcal/mol, which is in a good agreement with the experimental values extracted from measurements of water adsorption in other MOFs using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation10,13,36,37. The decrease in ΔH ads observed from 1.8% to 31% RH can be attributed to both the development of hydrogen bonds among water molecules and framework–water interactions. Since the hydrogen-bond network becomes more extended as the RH increases, the increase in enthalpy in correspondence of the adsorption step (i.e.~33% and ~37%) suggests that fr.........\n",

Tell us about your moment of realization and find all the submission details by visiting nytimes.com/divorcedparents. That link is also in our show notes. We can’t wait to hear from you. [MUSIC PLAYING] From The New York Times, I’m Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. When I was dating, I felt like people were always telling me to have fun. And, frankly, that ticked me off because I was like, this is not fun at all. I’m constantly confused, wondering if the person likes me, not sure if we want the same thing, terrified they’re ghosting me. Like, what is fun about that? Today’s essay is by Denny Agassi. Denny managed to do what I never could. She was actually having fun dating. She was on the apps, hooking up with guys, and genuinely having a good time, until she met this one guy who made her want more. [MUSIC PLAYING] Denny, welcome to Modern Love.\n",

      "Julia is a trans woman and bisexual. I’m heterosexual cis man. We have been dating for about five months and are moderately serious about each other in a “we didn’t spend the holidays together, but we told our families about each other” kind of way. Lately, Julia has started to tell people we meet within the LGBTQ community that I’m pansexual. That’s not how I identify, but when I object she argues that it’s accurate since I date her and that, besides, why does it bother me? The thing is that I find women attractive. Julia is a woman, the fact she’s a trans woman is just a descriptor like Korean woman or short-sighted woman (admittedly one that makes her quite vulnerable to hatred from people). My ex, through whom I met Julia, is a trans man and once I started seeing him that way, our relationship changed to more of a friendship (and we were going to be married). So in other words, I’m not open to dating anyone who isn’t a woman and that sounds straight to me. But I don’t know why it bothers me if Julia misidentifies me like that? It doesn’t generally matter to me what other people think, and I don’t think I’m ashamed that someone might assume I’m not straight. At the same time, telling people who we associate with that I’m something I’m not doesn’t feel right. At the very least it seems sort of dishonest.\n",

Additionally, overexpression of MFAP5 protein was also observed in PDAC tumor tissue compared with paired para-cancerous tissues in western blotting (Fig. 1B). To assess the correlation between MFAP5 expression level and clinical outcomes of PDAC patients, corresponding clinicopathological information of the surgically excised tumor tissues on the array were collected, and data showed that high-level of MFAP5 was associated with nerve invasion, higher tumor TNM stages and poorer differentiation (Fig. S2A; Table S1). Apart from these findings, clinicopathological analysis of the in-house serum samples showed that high-level serous MFAP5 was associated with higher CEA level and poorer tumor differentiation of PDAC patients (Table S2).

      "In the present study, we used the adenine-induced CKD mouse model which can mimic most of renal structural and functional changes in human CKD and require no surgery or genetic manipulation [27, 28]. To explore whether PXR plays a protective role in CKD, we constructed the adenine-induced CKD model in C57BL/6J mice and treated CKD mice with or without PCN, a specific exogenous agonist of mouse PXR, for 4 weeks [29]. The mice were divided into 4 groups: (i) Ctrl (mice were fed with normal diet), (ii) PCN (mice were fed with normal diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week), (iii) AD (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet), and (iv) AD + PCN (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week) (Fig. 1a) [30]. Compared with the Ctrl mice, adenine treatment resulted in a significant reduce in body size, granular changes on the surface of the kidneys, and a marked increase in the levels of serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24-h urinary albumin excretion, all of which was improved by PCN treatment (Fig. 1b–e). In addition, consistent with previous studies, the adenine diet led to a sharp decrease in body weight, kidney weight and urine osmolality (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b and f), a significant increase in relative kidney weight (the ratio of kidney weight to body weight), 24-h water intake and urine output in mice (Supplementary Fig. S1c–e) [24, 31]. To assess the effect of PCN on renal structural damage induced by adenine diet, we visualized paraffin sections with H&E staining and scored the renal tubulointerstitial (TI) damage (Fig. 1f, g). Mice in the Ctrl and PCN groups showed normal renal morphology, while mice in the AD group exhibited various renal structural damages, including renal tubular atroph.........\n",

      "First, we used the Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) database to investigate the level of USP13 transcript in different tumor tissues and found that USP13 was up-regulated in most of the digestive system neoplasms, including GC (Fig. 1A). The data from GEO dataset (GSE27342) also exhibited the up-regulation of USP13 in GC tissues (Fig. 1B). Then we analyzed the expression of USP13 in different GC grades and subtypes. The results indicated that the expression of USP13 was positively associated with the tumor grades (Fig. 1C). And compared to normal, the expression of USP13 was significantly increased in four different GC subtypes, with the highest average expression value in the EBV (epstein–barr virus) subtype and the lowest expression in the GS (genomically stable) subtype (Fig. 1D). We further used western blot to determine the protein level of USP13 in 32 pairs of GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues and found that the protein level of USP13 was elevated in 65.6% (21/32) of the GC tissues (Fig. 1E). We used ImageJ software to quantify the protein bands and statistically analyzed the data with paired t-test. The results showed that the protein level of USP13 was significantly increased in GC tissues (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1F). Additionally, we used Kaplan–Meier Plotter database to analyze the correlation between USP13 exprsssion and the overall survival (OS) of GC patients. Since the dataset GSE62254 in Kaplan–Meier Plotter database contains markedly different characteristics from all other datasets, we excluded GSE62254 from pooled analysis and analyzed GSE62254 separately. The results from three different Affymetrix probes (205356_at, 227788_at, 226902_at) showed similar trends that higher expression of USP13 in GC tissues resulted in shorter overall survival (OS) of GC patients both in the pooled analysis excludi.........\n",

For the design and cloning of lentiviral METTL14 and ZCCHC8 shRNAs, we followed the Addgene pLKO.1 shRNA cloning protocol (https://www.addgene.org/protocols/plko/). In brief, oligos containing the targeting sequences of each gene (listed below) were annealed and ligated to the pLKO.1 cloning vector via AgeI and EcoRI sites. For lentiviral 160× GGGGCC repeat expression, the fragment of 80× GGGGCC was cut out from the pcDNA5-FRT-TO-(GGGGCC) 80 -NLuc by KpnI and SmaI and cloned back via the KpnI and BssHII (blunt) sites upstream of the (GGGGCC) 80 in the original pcDNA5-FRT-TO-(GGGGCC) 80 -NLuc plasmid to expand the repeat length to 160× GGGGCC repeats.

      "This study examined the relationships between impaired insight and (i) cortical thickness, and (ii) subcortical volumes in patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. We found cortical thinning in the left inferior and middle frontal regions, supramarginal gyrus, and the temporal pole in relation to impaired insight, particularly in treatment-resistant patients where insight deficits may be more chronic. Our results are consistent with prior studies that reported more pronounced cortical thinning and volume loss in treatment-resistant patients compared to non-treatment-resistant patients64,65. In treatment-resistant patients, the relationship remained significant even after controlling for illness severity and CPZ antipsychotic drug dose equivalents. The ROI analyses also identified an association between impaired general illness awareness (i.e., VAGUS general illness awareness domain) and cortical thinning in the left supramarginal gyrus. We found no associations between impaired insight and subcortical volumes.\n",

      "A previous study by our group that examined the structural and functional correlates of insight found a direct link between cortical thinning and brain activity.

The results of other studies that have focused on examining the relationship between impaired insight and cortical thickness have been inconsistent14,17,18,19,66. The inconsistencies in the literature may be due to a number of factors, including limited sample size and different methods of measuring insight into illness14,17,18,19.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study found an association between statin use and a high prevalence of non-senile cataracts, but this appeared to be entirely explained by the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors (which was expectedly higher in individuals who were prescribed statins). In a large cohort of British South Asian ancestry participants who were prescribed statins, individuals carrying a SLCO1B1*5 allele had a 30% lower risk of developing non-senile cataract in comparison with individuals who did not carry this polymorphism known to lead to higher systemic exposure to statins (Fig. 3). As the SLCO1B1*5 allele has been linked with muscle related ADRs, we have undertaken this two-step analysis to show that the SLCO1B1*5-statin association with decreased cataract prevalence is not likely to be due to decreased exposure to statin through lower doses or non-compliance in those with SLCO1B1*5. If the protective SNP-drug effect seen were due to less statin exposure in those with a SLCO1B1*5 allele we would expect to see an association of statin use with cataracts independent of confounding factors in the first step of the analysis. We show that such an association is not present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings add a significant piece of the puzzle in the controversy regarding association between statins and cataracts, suggesting that pharmacogene association with statins are responsible for decreased non-senile cataract risk by higher exposure to statins. This is proof of concept that stratification by pharmacogene in observational on-drug cohorts can be helpful in clarifying drug association with putative adverse drug events. The G&H South Asian ancestry cohort is uniquely suited for this study due to high rates of cardiometabolic disease, and therefore a high-risk profile for non-senile cataracts.\n",

      "The goal of this study was to identify PFC GM volumetric markers of early infant negative and positive emotionality, that may reflect neural mechanisms underlying the development of infant emotionality and predict risk of future psychopathology later in childhood and beyond. Our in-house cortical parcellation pipeline made it possible to reliably extract GM volumes in different PFC subregions from either T1- or T2-weighted 3-month infant brain sMRI data. We used two-model approaches to model and interpret the relationships between PFC subregional GM volumes and infant NE or PE. We observed a positive association between 3-month SFC GM volume and concurrent (3-month) NE, and a negative association between 3-month vlPFC volume and prospective (9-month) PE. These findings were also validated with an independent replication sample, demonstrating the stability of the findings from the primary sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our finding that 3-month SFC GM volume was positively associated with concurrent NE provides some support for our hypothesis that greater DMN GM volume would be associated with greater NE, as the SFC is a cortical midline prefrontal cortical component of the DMN that is implicated in the processing of self-related information and evaluating others’ mental states [62, 63]. Furthermore, while the SFC is also involved in other functions, including cognitive control and motor functions, the anteromedial part of the SFC, in particular, has robust connectivity with other DMN regions [64]. Our finding is also consistent with previous reports of greater cortical thickness in the left rostral SFC in adolescents with anxiety disorders [65]. Additionally, in a young adult study, greater right rostral SFC GM volume was observed in social anxiety disorder patients compared with healthy controls [66]. Thus, greater SFC GM volume is a promising neural marker of higher early infant NE..........\n",

      "\n",
      "The present study is the first to report an AI-based automated system for the assessment of Fishman’s SMI, which is widely used in dental fields, especially in orthodontics. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have been reported on the automation of skeletal maturation assessment using AI for the improvement of clinical efficiency and reproducibility. The vast majority of these proposed systems are based on TW3 method12,17,18,19, as it has several advantages over other methods. Firstly, it takes into account the variability of skeletal maturation pattern in different populations and ethnic groups. Unlike its predecessor, TW2, which derived from a sample of British children20, TW3 was developed using additional data from multiple ethnic groups and populations7. Later studies have also shown its validity in various populations, including Korean children21,22,23. Furthermore, TW3 method offers a comprehensive evaluation of skeletal maturity by assessing multiple bones, leading to a more thorough analysis of skeletal development and improved reliability. On the other hand, a major drawback of TW3 is the complexity and time required to obtain results. This limitation has been addressed through the use of AI-based systems. Another limitation of TW3 is that it does not account for changes in the trend of maturational development over time. This could lead to potential obsolescence of the method, much like its predecessor TW2. Therefore, periodic updates are necessary to maintain the validity and reliability of the TW method7.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key novel finding of this study was that the individual level of SBP amplification was significantly associated with the accuracy of cuff measured SBP. This was confirmed in independent study samples and across several different automated cuff BP measurement devices, each using unique proprietary algorithms to estimate BP. The accuracy of cuff measured SBP was highest among individuals with the lowest levels of SBP amplification, and cuff SBP progressively underestimated intra-arterial brachial SBP as SBP amplification increased. Multiple regression analysis identified SBP amplification as the factor explaining most of the variance in the accuracy of cuff measured SBP compared with intra-arterial brachial SBP. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report such findings, which provide insight on a key factor relevant the accuracy of conventional upper arm automated cuff BP methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observed relationship between cuff accuracy and SBP amplification could be explained by the automated cuff measurement method itself, which has similar operating principles between devices (albeit having different algorithms) and employs analytical processes that are largely unchanged for decades [17,18,19]. A variety of propriety algorithms can be applied (e.g. using fixed-ratio coefficients) to estimate SBP and DBP at specific fractions of the envelope peak. These BPs are designed to copy the BP values recorded by manual auscultation [20, 21]. A critical factor relating to automated cuff BP compared with auscultatory BP is that individual differences in the shape of the waveform envelope result in different levels of accuracy of the estimated BP values [22,23,24]. Alongside this, we have observed phenotypic differences in the brachial arterial waveform shapes [9] (and consequent estimation of mean arterial pressure) [25] between individuals with low- compared to high- SBP amplification.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The p38 MAPK family was first identified in studies of endotoxin-induced cytokine expression [11]. P38 is involved in inflammation, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell death, and the cell cycle [12]. There are four p38 isoforms including p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (SAPK3, ERK6 orMAPK12), and p38δ (MAPK13) with an overall sequence homology >60% and an identity within the kinase domains >90% [13]. The four p38 MAPK isoforms are ubiquitously expressed with different levels of expression in various tissues (Fig. 1). For example p38α is expressed in all cell types and tissues; p38β is predominant in the brain; p38γ is found in skeletal muscle and p38δ is mainly expressed in the testis, pancreas, kidney and small intestine [14]. Despite the high level of sequence homology of the four isoforms, they interact with different downstream effectors such as: MK2 (MAPK-activating protein kinase 2), PRAK (p38-related/activated protein kinase), ATF-2 (activating transcription factor-2), MEF2 (myocyte enhancement factor 2) and c-Jun and upstream MAPK kinase activators (including MKK4, MKK3 and MKK6) [15]. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK can activate a wide range of stimuli, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, cytoplasmic substrates and nuclear substrates [16]. The downstream events of these p-p38 MAPK have cell-specific consequences including regulation of RNA splicing, cytokine production, inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and cell differentiation [16]. Activated p38α has been shown to downregulate cyclins, upregulate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, modulate the tumor suppressor p53 at the G1/S and the G2/M phases and induce apoptosis. This reduces cell proliferation in primary cells (cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells, and airway epithelium). In contrast, p38α has also been shown to support cell survival via anti-apoptotic inflammatory signals interleukin-6 (IL-6) and en.........\n",

      "The TME is a complex milieu that surrounds tumor cells, often providing immunosuppressive cover that facilitates immune invasion. Specifically, competition for nutrients or cell-intrinsic programming between cancer cells and immune cells induces nutrient deficiency and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, leading to modulation of antitumor immunity128,129. Given that activation and differentiation of immune cells are coupled to metabolic reprogramming, regulating the metabolic activity of immune cells should be considered in the development of potential strategies that target glutamine metabolism130,131.\n",

      "Glutamine metabolism in immune cells\n",
      "\n",
      "Accumulating evidence shows that glutamine is an immunomodulatory nutrient in immune cells. Naïve T cells are metabolically quiescent, undergoing basal levels of glycolysis and glutaminolysis sufficient to maintain minimal biosynthesis; however, T-cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated activation increases the expression of the Myc transcription factor, glutamine transporters (SLC38A1, SLC38A2), and glutaminolysis-related enzymes (GLS, GLUD1, GOT, GPT) to meet bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements, resulting in T-cell proliferation130,131,132,133. TCR-induced activation of mTORC1 and metabolic signaling pathways requires SLC1A5-dependent uptake of glutamine; indeed, an SLC1A5-deficient mouse model shows decreased induction of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells but not Th2, regulatory T (Treg), or CD8(+) T cells, leading to a decrease in proinflammatory T-cell responses134. Recent studies have shown that glutamine-derived α-KG regulates the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th1-type effector T cells or Treg cells via DNA methylation and lipid homeostasis135,136. Mechanistically, α-KG decreases Treg differentiation by inhibiting FOXP3 and upregulating inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, Tbet, and Rorc, suggesting that Th1-type effector T cells are more dep.........\n",

      "In the present study, we used the adenine-induced CKD mouse model which can mimic most of renal structural and functional changes in human CKD and require no surgery or genetic manipulation [27, 28]. To explore whether PXR plays a protective role in CKD, we constructed the adenine-induced CKD model in C57BL/6J mice and treated CKD mice with or without PCN, a specific exogenous agonist of mouse PXR, for 4 weeks [29]. The mice were divided into 4 groups: (i) Ctrl (mice were fed with normal diet), (ii) PCN (mice were fed with normal diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week), (iii) AD (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet), and (iv) AD + PCN (mice were fed with 0.2% adenine diet and treated with PCN at 50 mg/kg, twice a week) (Fig. 1a) [30]. Compared with the Ctrl mice, adenine treatment resulted in a significant reduce in body size, granular changes on the surface of the kidneys, and a marked increase in the levels of serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24-h urinary albumin excretion, all of which was improved by PCN treatment (Fig. 1b–e). In addition, consistent with previous studies, the adenine diet led to a sharp decrease in body weight, kidney weight and urine osmolality (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b and f), a significant increase in relative kidney weight (the ratio of kidney weight to body weight), 24-h water intake and urine output in mice (Supplementary Fig. S1c–e) [24, 31]. To assess the effect of PCN on renal structural damage induced by adenine diet, we visualized paraffin sections with H&E staining and scored the renal tubulointerstitial (TI) damage (Fig. 1f, g). Mice in the Ctrl and PCN groups showed normal renal morphology, while mice in the AD group exhibited various renal structural damages, including renal tubular atroph.........\n",

      "\n",
      "Natural killer cells are the first sentinels of the immune system against malignant cells, expressing a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors that determine their fate [49]. Under a hemostatic state, NK cells are tightly regulated by inhibitory receptors, and their ligands are normally expressed in non-tumor cells [49]. However, after malignant transformation, tumorous cells express several molecules that can be recognized by activating receptors on NK cells, leading to their immediate activation and cytolytic activity [49]. Undergoing rapid microevolution, tumor cells acquire several functionalities to suppress the function of NK cells, enabling them to evade the immune system [50]. Recent discoveries have established tumor cell-derived sEVs as important players in NK cell dysfunction [4]. Several sEV-associated biomolecules including proteins, lipids, miRNAs, and lncRNAs have been recognized so far to abolish the anti-tumor responses of immune cells, including NK cells [4]. Of note, TGF-β is a well-known inhibitor of NK cells and its serum levels among cancerous patients were confirmed to be strongly correlated with the status of NK cell dysfunction [51,52,53]. Clinical data show that tumor-derived TGF-β is associated with NKG2D downregulation on NK, NKT, CD8+, and γδT cells, whose aberrant loss in cancer is a key mechanism of immune evasion [54]. Similarly, TGF-β carried in sEVs emanating from tumors was shown to abolish NK cell responses via NKG.........\n",

      "My boyfriend made an offhand remark that if I had looked the way I look now when we first met (a year and a half ago), he wouldn’t have been interested in me. I was hurt and shocked. Initially, he made excuses, claiming that he was talking about my lifestyle since I started working long hours at a big law firm and that he was trying to motivate me to be healthier. But his remark was about how I look, and he knows I’m well aware of the five to 10 pounds I’ve gained. Eventually, he apologized. Still, I’m having a hard time getting over this. It shook my sense of security. He’s usually a thoughtful guy and tells me I’m beautiful. Should I try harder to let this go?\n",

      "Honestly, I don’t see how you can let this go. Either your boyfriend’s remark was true (and he is suggesting a weight cap for you regardless of the circumstances of your life) or it was mean (and meant to throw you off balance). It seems highly unlikely to me that he landed a direct hit by accident.\n",

      "So, that leaves his apology — which had better be good. Unless he is able to communicate how and why he hurt you, promise it will not happen again and ask sincerely for your forgiveness, dump him and don’t look back. Many of us say hurtful things to our partners. When we do, it’s on us to restore their faith in us. If your boyfriend can’t do that, this relationship is unlikely to be a healthy one.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Schools and colleges across the U.S. would be forbidden from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes under a proposal released Thursday from the Biden administration, but teams could create some limits in certain cases — for example, to ensure fairness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed rule sends a political counterpunch toward a wave of Republican-led states that have sought to ban trans athletes from competing in school sports that align with their gender identities. If finalized, the proposal would become enshrined as a provision of Title IX, the landmark gender equity legislation enacted in 1972.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must undergo a lengthy approval process, however, and it’s almost certain to face challenges. While opponents sharply criticized the proposal, some advocates for transgender athletes were concerned that it did not go far enough.\n",

      "The proposal comes on the same day that the Supreme Court said a 12-year-old transgender girl in West Virginia can continue competing on her middle school track and cross-country teams while legal battles over the state’s transgender law continue. The law bans transgender athletes from female teams.\n",

      "All told, at least 16 states now have bans in effect covering at least high school interscholastic sports. Some also extend to intramural, club or college sports.

      "The proposed rule, which still faces a lengthy approval process, establishes that blanket bans, like those that have been approved in at least 20 states, would violate Title IX, the landmark gender-equity legislation enacted in 1972. But schools that receive federal funding could still adopt policies that limit transgender students’ participation, particularly in more competitive high school and college sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the proposal, it would be much more difficult for schools to ban, for example, a transgender girl in elementary school from playing on a girls basketball team. But it would also leave room for schools to develop policies that prohibit trans athletes from playing on more competitive teams if those policies are designed to ensure fairness or prevent sports-related injuries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Typically, {P 8 W 48 } has been synthesized as a Li+/K+ salt, which does not provide the controlled introduction of silver atoms into the cavity of {P 8 W 48 }. Therefore, an organic-solvent soluble TBA+ (TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium; (nBu) 4 N+) salt of {P 8 W 48 } (P8W48)46, in which all alkali ions were removed, was used for the synthesis of silver nanoclusters. After reacting P8W48 and AgOAc (OAc = acetate) in acetone, X-ray crystallographic analysis of the yellow crystalline product (Ag16) revealed that 16 Ag+ ions were arranged on the inner surface of {P 8 W 48 } (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed two peaks at 368.6 eV (Ag 3d 5/2 ) and 374.6 eV (Ag 3d 3/2 ) assignable to Ag+ (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 3)47, indicating that the oxidation states of all silver atoms are +1. Recently, Cronin et al. reported the reaction of the Li+/K+ salt of {P 8 W 48 } and Ag+ in aqueous solution, and Ag+ ions were introduced both inside (11 Ag+ ions) and outside (10 Ag+ ions) {P 8 W 48 } (ref. 48). In contrast, in the case of the Ag16, 16 Ag+ ions were selectively introduced only inside {P 8 W 48 }, probably because the alkali ions (for example, K+, Li+) were completely removed from P8W48.\n",

      "Zirconia is an ionic material with a large phonon anharmonicity and it has been shown that zirconia doped with about 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 consists mainly of a meta-stable tetragonal phase at room temperature26,27. In this work, we used commercial partially stabilized zirconia ceramic plates (3.5 mol% Y 2 O 3 ) with a high volume-fraction of t-ZrO 2 . t-ZrO 2 becomes cubic (c-ZrO 2 ) at higher temperatures and can become monoclinic (m-ZrO 2 ) due to mechanical strain26,27,28. Figure 1a shows the crystal structures of ZrO 2 (different projections are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). The skeleton of the m-ZrO 2 lattice exhibits a shear distortion of 9° parallel to the basal plane of the unit cell of t-ZrO 2 26. Since the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation is accompanied by a volume expansion, the microcracks that are normally caused by the deformation of a polycrystalline material, are suppressed via this stress-induced transformation of t-ZrO 2 26,27,28,29. Figure 1b shows the infrared reflection and Raman spectra of one the zirconia ceramic plates. Note that t-ZrO 2 has infrared phonon modes at 4.2 THz (T u ), 10.2 THz (A 2u ) and near 13 THz (T u )30. In this work, either the infrared phonon mode at 4.2 THz or that at 10.2 THz was excited resonantly by appropriately tuning the THz-FEL parameters (see Methods). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data of our sample are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.\n",

      "To determine the rate coefficients of the reaction between CH 2 OO and HCHO and to evaluate their temperature and pressure dependencies, we first performed the kinetic measurements under different total pressures at 296 K. Over 63 measurements in seven sets were carried out at experimental conditions with [CH 2 OO] 0 = (5.5–8.6) × 1012 molecules cm−3, [HCHO] 0 = (1.8–34.5) × 1014 molecules cm−3, and total pressure P T = 6.4–56.0 Torr at 296 K. For kinetic studies of the reaction CH 2 OO + HCHO under pseudo-first-order conditions ([HCHO]»[CH 2 OO]), the decay in the concentration of CH 2 OO with time can be described using a single-exponential formula:\n",

      "in which [CH 2 OO] obs (t) represents the observed CH 2 OO concentration as a function of time, [CH 2 OO] 0 represents the initial concentration of CH 2 OO, and k obs represents the overall decay rate coefficient for the observed CH 2 OO:\n",

      "Thermodynamics of water adsorption\n",
      "\n",
      "The experimental adsorption isotherm of water in NU-1500-Cr (Fig. 1A) slowly increases up to ~33% RH where it exhibits a sharp step that effectively ends at ~37% RH, after which it only shows a moderate increase up to ~70% RH. It should be noted that the adsorption isotherm shown in Fig. 1A slightly differs from the adsorption isotherm reported in ref. 18. The difference is due to the use of an incorrect value of the saturated vapor pressure of water at 298 K in the original study, which results to the original adsorption isotherm being shifted to slightly higher RH values relative the adsorption isotherm measured in the present study. To gain insights into the confining effects of the framework on the properties of water adsorbed in the pores, the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔH ads ) and water entropy (S wat ) calculated from MD simulations carried out as a function of RH are shown in Fig. 1B, C respectively. ΔH ads becomes progressively more negative, indicating stronger framework–water interactions, as the RH increases and plateaus at a value of ~ − 14.5 kcal/mol between 15% and 31% RH. After this point, ΔH ads rapidly increases to a value of ~ − 12.5 kcal/mol in correspondence of the step in the adsorption isotherm between ~33% and ~37% RH and remains approximately constant at higher RH. At the lowest RH, the calculated enthalpy of adsorption is −13.4 kcal/mol, which is in a good agreement with the experimental values extracted from measurements of water adsorption in other MOFs using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation10,13,36,37. The decrease in ΔH ads observed from 1.8% to 31% RH can be attributed to both the development of hydrogen bonds among water molecules and framework–water interactions. Since the hydrogen-bond network becomes more extended as the RH increases, the increase in enthalpy in correspondence of the adsorption step (i.e.~33% and ~37%) suggests that fr.........\n",
