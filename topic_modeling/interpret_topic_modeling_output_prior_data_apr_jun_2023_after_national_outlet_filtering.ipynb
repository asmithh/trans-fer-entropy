      "New rules for competitive events, due to be implemented this year, will see racing split into “open” and “female” categories, with transgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals and those whose sex was assigned male at birth eligible to compete in the open category.\n",
      "\n",
      "The female category will remain for those whose sex was assigned female at birth and for transgender men who are yet to begin hormone therapy.\n",

      "The current men’s category will be consolidated into the open category, in which those whose sex was assigned as female at birth can also compete if they so wish.\n",

      "The new policy is the result of a nine-month review which included a consultation process with riders and stakeholders, including members of Britain’s team, as well as a study of available medical research led by British Cycling’s chief medical officer, Dr. Nigel Jones. That research was said to show a clear performance advantage for individuals who go through puberty as a male, and one which cannot be fully mitigated by testosterone suppression.\n",

The video confirmed what many of us knew or at least suspected: Banko wasn’t killed in “self-defense” as Jenkins predictably and publicly stated from the start, he was murdered.\n",

      "Despite the blatant video evidence that shows that Banko was murdered, Jenkins — the pro-cop Afro-Latina DA who was appointed by our very own right-wing mayor London Breed to “save” our “rogue” city — is still refusing to charge Banko’s killer. And for that, among many other things, she should resign.\n",

      "People who have received the two-dose vaccination do not have to be re- vaccinated. While cases have been reported in fully vaccinated people, the vaccine is still highly effective and the best tool for Mpox prevention, according to the HHSA.

      "\"We are asking for people who are at risk of Mpox to get vaccinated or get up to date on their vaccinations and consider taking steps to prevent Mpox exposure,\" said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, county deputy public health officer. \"I am confident we can build off the collaboration and partnerships developed last year with the LGBTQ+ community to protect those at risk.\"\n",

      "A federal judge struck down Arkansas' first-in-the-nation ban on gender-affirming care for children as unconstitutional Tuesday, the first ruling to overturn such a prohibition as a growing number of Republican-led states adopt similar restrictions.Related video above: Arkansas state senator Bart Hester discusses proposed transgender surgery billU.S. District Judge Jay Moody issued a permanent injunction against the Arkansas law, which would have prohibited doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18.Arkansas' law, which Moody temporarily blocked in 2021, also would have prohibited doctors from referring patients elsewhere for such care. At least 19 other states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors following Arkansas’ law, and nearly all of them have been challenged in court.In his order, Moody ruled that the prohibition violated the due process and equal protection rights of transgender youth and families. He said the law also violated the First Amendment rights of medical providers.“Rather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence showed that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of patients and that, by prohibiting it, the state undermined the interests it claims to be advancing,” Moody wrote in his ruling.Moody’s ruling echoed remarks that judges have made in other decisions temporarily blocking similar bans in Alabama and Indiana.Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement he planned to appeal Moody's ruling to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which last year upheld the judge's temporary order against the law.

      "The Nebraska Legislature on Friday approved a 12-week abortion ban and restrictions on gender-affirming care for children in a move so contentious that lawmakers on both sides have said they may be unable to work together in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative lawmakers wrangled just enough votes to end a filibuster and pass a bill with both measures. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen, who pushed for the bill and met with various lawmakers to shore up support, has promised to sign it into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mood in the Nebraska Capitol has been volatile since lawmakers on Tuesday advanced by a single vote the hybrid measure that ties together restrictions that Republicans across the U.S. have been pushing. Nebraska's lawmakers have traded insults and promises of retribution, while protesters have loudly voiced their displeasure. Nebraska's ban comes the same week North Carolina affirmed a 12-week ban on abortion, overriding that governor's veto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday's debate was briefly stopped when protesters in a chamber balcony stood and yelled obscenities at conservative lawmakers while throwing what appeared to be bloody tampons onto the floor. Security arrested at least one person and cleared the balconies. As lawmakers began voting, chants of, \"Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!\" could be heard coming from outside the chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nebraska had not passed a new abortion ban since the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. The state currently bans abortion starting around 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 12-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill also would prevent transgender people 18 or younger from receiving any gender-confirming surgery. The state's chief medical officer — a political appointee who is currently an ear, nose and throat doctor — would set rules for puberty blockers and hormone therapies.

      "In a city known for its support of LGBTQ+ rights, San Francisco Mayor London Breed says it was a natural step to create a position that not only embraces drag culture but puts government resources toward it. D'Arcy Drollinger, a well-known drag performer and nightclub owner, will receive a $55,000 stipend in her 18-month role as the city's inaugural drag laureate.\n",

      "“Friday, we celebrate the feast of Jesus’ Sacred Heart,” Gomez said in a statement. “… We will be praying in a special way for our city and country, for an end to prejudice, and for renewed respect for the religious beliefs of all Angelenos and all Americans.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Neoliberal capitalism comes under scathing and thought-provoking artistic critique by renowned Spanish artist Isaac Cordal in his politically engaged new exhibition, “Smoke Signals,” which includes miniature sculptures, photography and diverse installations. Cordal uses his miniature statuettes to refigure space, fragment time, point to larger social issues and stand as imperfect constructions of a social order rooted in a mix of absurdity and oppression. Cordal’s sculptures inhabit those abandoned spaces that need to be reclaimed, reimagined and understood as sites of social and political change. In this exhibition, his art offers a searing critique of the capitalist notion of progress and its devastating assault on nature and the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smoke Signals,” which will appear June 8-18 at the MURAL Festival in Montreal, continues Cordal’s ongoing project of advocating for the democratization of public space and criticizing neoliberal capitalism while promoting a vision of community that enables open dialogue, shared notions of solidarity, and relations of mutual trust and compassion. Moreover, as Naomi Larsson observed in The Guardian, his art in its various expressions “represent a social stereotype as a critical observation on capitalism, power and bureaucracy.” In the photo essay included at the end of this piece, you can see for yourself some examples of how Cordal’s art challenges the brutality of neoliberal capitalism.\n",

      "In the contemporary U.S., this authoritarian politics of disappearance manifests in new ways every week. In March 2023 alone, examples of this include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s efforts to remove discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation from all grades in Florida’s public school system. The American Library Association released a report indicating a sharp upsurge in the far right’s attempts to ban books and place restrictions on public libraries. The report stated that “2,571 unique titles were targeted for censorship, a 38% increase from the 1,858 unique titles targeted for censorship in 2021,” adding, “of those titles, the vast majority were written by or about members of the LGBTQIA+ community and people of color.”\n",

      "Librarians are increasingly the subject of online harassment, fear for their jobs, and “feel scared.” Across the country, Republican politicians are removing protections provided by child labor laws in a move likely to “put kids in dangerous situations.” Moreover, LGBTQ children and their caregivers are under attack, and spaces where they can exist without fear are disappearing as a result of the ongoing repressive assaults and gender-erasing policies produced by the GOP.

      "The long shadow of domestic fascism, defined as a project of racial and cultural cleansing, is with us once again both in North America and abroad. Educators have seen the ghosts of fascism before in acts of savage colonialism and dispossession, in an era of slavery marked by the brutality of whippings and neck irons, and in a Jim Crow age most obvious in the spectacularized horror of murderous lynchings. More recently we have viewed fascist acts of terror in a politics of disappearances and genocidal erasures under the dictatorships of Adolf Hitler, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and others. And in each case, history has given us a glimpse of what the end of humanity would look like.[1] Yet the lessons of history with its language of hate, machineries of torture, death camps and murderous violence as a political tool are too often ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "The promise and ideals of democracy are receding as right-wing extremists breathe new life into a fascist past. This is particularly true as education has increasingly become a tool of domination as right-wing pedagogical apparatuses controlled by the entrepreneurs of hate attack workers, the poor, people of color, trans people, immigrants from the south, and others considered disposable. Confronting this fascist counter-revolutionary movement necessitates creating a new language and the building of a mass social movement in order to construct empowering terrains of education, politics, justice, culture, and power that challenge existing systems of white supremacy, white nationalism, manufactured ignorance, civic illiteracy and economic oppression.\n",

      "Capitalism has always been constructed on the basis of organized violence. Wedded to a political and economic system that consolidates power in the hands of a financial, cultural social elite, it construes profit making as the essence of democracy and consuming as the only obligation of citizenship. Matters of ethics, social responsibility, the welfare state, and the social contract are viewed as enemies of the market, thus legitimating the subordination of human needs to a relentless drive for accumulating profits at the expense of vital social needs and the larger public.[1] Driven by a ruthless emphasis on privatization, deregulation, commodification, a sclerotic individualism and ruthless model of competition—neoliberal capitalism has morphed into a machinery of death—an unabashed form of gangster capitalism.\n",

Vance (R-Ohio) have declared a war on institutions of public and higher education, which they’ve identified as centers of “unpatriotic education.” Most far right Republicans fear higher education as a bulwark against their authoritarianism and hence see students as a threat to their propaganda machines and fascist politics. As a result, the right wing has kicked into overdrive in an attempt to target educational institutions as a site for policing dissent, eliminating unions, indoctrinating faculty and students, and for normalizing white Christian nationalism, white supremacy and pedagogies of repression.\n",
