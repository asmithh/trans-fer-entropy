# Zero Shot Filtering 

This pipeline is still under development, but is ready to be tested or used *cautiously*.

The primary matters left to make this fully functional are:
1. test it on some small, labeled subset of articles
2. test other prompt strings
3. try few shot, if we are able to label some articles
