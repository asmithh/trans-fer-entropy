It tripled the domestic opening weekend revenue of its prequel.\\n\\nOver a dozen Muslim-majority countries pulled the blockbuster film from theaters without explanation.\\n\\nMany people believe the film was banned because of the inclusion of a transgender poster in the background of one frame during the movie.\\n\\nThe new blockbuster movie \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" was abruptly removed from cinema listings in more than a dozen Muslim-majority countries without explanation, apparently over the inclusion of a blink-and-you-miss-it transgender poster in the background of one frame.\\n\\nEmpire Entertainment, the Middle East distributor for the computer-animated Sony Pictures film, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\nNo explicit bans of the film were announced, but there were indications that it will not reach screens.\\n\\nFor example, there is no expectation that \"Across the Spider-Verse\" will be shown in the United Arab Emirates, said a source close to the film who was not authorized to speak publicly. The source cited rigorous censorship of movies for children and younger viewers.\\n\\n\\'SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE\\' FIRST MARVEL SUPERHERO FILM TO WIN AN OSCAR\\n\\nOn the official Saudi Cinema twitter page, a statement with a poster of the film attached said the organization will not approve any film that contradicts the nation’s media content regulations and whose \"production companies do not commit to implementing the required amendments.\"\\n\\nThe superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales as Spider-Man debuted in U.S. cinemas at the beginning of June, tripling the domestic opening weekend revenue of its Oscar-winning prequel.\\n\\nInitially, it was scheduled to open in the Mideast on June 22, ahead of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. The film was listed in cinema programs as recently as last week in countries such as Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Egypt, but was abruptly and quietly pulled.\\n\\nNo reasons were given, but the brief transgender reference might have caused offense in Arab countries where Muslim majorities, guided by Islamic law, or Sharia, often consider homosexuality and transgender identity as sinful and contrary to their religious beliefs and societal norms.\\n\\n\\'SPIDER-MAN\\' STARS SAY \\'SPIDER-VERSE\\' BREAKS THE MOLD\\n\\nThe film includes a scene where a transgender flag printed with the words \"Protect Trans Kids\" is hanging in the room of Gwen Stacy, a spider superhero and character voiced by actress Hailee Steinfeld.\\n\\nThe UAE, home to the futuristic city of Dubai and the world\\'s tallest skyscraper, has not officially banned the movie. The federation of seven sheikhdoms once reported an end to its censorship of cinematic releases in an effort to boost its brand as a liberal hub attractive to foreigners, but it has continued to pull some movies from its theatres.\\n\\nEmaar Entertainment, a state-owned entity and parent company of major UAE cinema company Reel Cinemas, confirmed to The Associated Press that it won’t be screening \"Across the Spider-Verse\". The company attributed the decision to Empire Entertainment, the exclusive theatrical distributor for Sony Pictures movies in the Middle East.\\n\\nEmpire Entertainment, the UAE Ministry of Youth and Culture and the Saudi Ministry of Communications and Information Technology could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nIn a similar incident last year, Disney’s \"Lightyear\" was banned in 13 Muslim-majority nations for featuring a scene with a lesbian kiss. The moment had been earlier cut from the film but was restored after Pixar employees protested Disney’s response to Florida legislation that opponents dubbed as the \"Don’t Say Gay\" bill.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Into the Spider-Verse,\" the prequel to \"Across the Spider-Verse,\" had a successful run in the region when it premiered in 2018.

For seven and a half years of my adult life, I was never paid.\"\\n\\n\"19 Kids and Counting\" was a ratings juggernaut for TLC until the show was canceled after allegations surfaced in May 2015 that the oldest Duggar son, Josh, had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter when he was 12. In 2021, Josh was convicted of possessing child pornography and sentenced to 12 ½ years in prison.\\n\\nDUGGAR DOCUSERIES ‘SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE’ REVEALS SHOCKING SECRETS ABOUT REALITY TV FAMILY\\n\\nAfter the original series\\' cancellation, TLC launched \"Counting On,\" which followed the lives of the Duggar children and their families as well as parents Jim Bob and Michelle. Josh was not included in the show though his wife, Anna, and six children were featured.\\n\\nAccording to People magazine, Jim Bob was the primary payee throughout the runs of both shows and earned an estimated $25,000 to $45,000 paycheck per episode.\\n\\nIn \"Shiny Happy People,\" Jill and Derick alleged that they did not receive any share of the money that was paid to Jim Bob during their time on \"19 Kids and Counting\" and \"Counting On.\"\\n\\nJill was 17 when \"19 Kids and Counting\" debuted in September 2008. Derick and Jim Bob became prayer partners in 2013, and the Duggar family patriarch later introduced his future son-in-law to Jill. Jim Bob and Jill later traveled to Nepal to visit Derick while he was doing mission work in Kathmandu.\\n\\nDerick and Jill officially began courting during the trip, which was featured on the eighth season of \"19 Kids and Counting.\"\\n\\nOn June 21, 2014, the couple married in a televised wedding that aired on the show in October of that year. The couple\\'s wedding episode brought in a then-record 4.4 million viewers and became TLC\\'s most-watched telecast in four years.\\n\\nIn \"Shiny Happy People,\" Jill claimed she was deceived by Jim Bob into signing a contract that extended her commitment to TLC on the day before her wedding.\\n\\n\"I just saw the signature page,\" she said. \"It was like, on the end of the kitchen table, like, ‘Hey, I just need you guys to sign these.\\' Like, everyone was signing them. We were literally running through the kitchen, and it was like, whoever you could grab on the way through. I didn’t know what it was for.\"\\n\\nJOSH DUGGAR SEEN SMILING IN MUGSHOT PHOTO AFTER RECEIVING GUILTY VERDICT IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY TRIAL\\n\\nWhen asked who had her sign the contract, Jill replied, \"My dad.\"\\n\\nDerick said, \"What we found out later was that it was a commitment of your life for the next five years to the show.\"\\n\\n\"They had their negotiations, they had their business meetings,\" Jill said. \"It just wasn\\'t with us.\"\\n\\nLess than two months after tying the knot, Jill and Derick announced that they were expecting their first child.\\n\\nIn the docuseries, Jill recalled that she and Derick were initially opposed to filming her delivery for the show. TLC had previously filmed Michelle and Anna giving birth, and Jill recalled that they expected to film her birth as well. Episodes that featured weddings and births typically brought in some of the series\\' highest ratings.\\n\\nDerick and Jill said the production company approached them a few weeks before Jill gave birth about filming the delivery. Jill said the producers offered to only have one camera operator in the hospital room.\\n\\n\"And I was like, \\'Well, actually, we don\\'t want you guys there at all,\\'\" Jill said, noting that they were shocked at the couple\\'s refusal.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t want to go through what Anna went through,\" Derick said.\\n\\n\"I knew for sure, I was like, \\'Nobody\\'s in my delivery room, like nobody. And nobody\\'s there for the labor watching me. Like, I don\\'t want any of that,\\'\" Jill said.\\n\\n\"We basically lost, and they\\'re going to get what they want,\" Derick said.\\n\\nThe couple said the production company gave them cameras and tripods so that they could shoot footage for the show themselves.\\n\\n\"We did diary cams,\" Jill said. \"We did a lot of work. So they still got, you know, the footage.\"\\n\\nAfter the birth of Jill\\'s son, Israel, she said the couple asked TLC just to pay them enough to cover the out-of-pocket costs of their insurance for Israel\\'s birth.\\n\\n\"They said they pay the family. Pay the family means we don\\'t get anything at that point,\" Derick recalled before saying, \"They said, ‘Well, we paid your dad. So,take it up with him.’\"\\n\\nIn 2016, Jill and Derick were working as missionaries in El Salvador . A TLC crew traveled to the Central American country to film them for the spinoff show, which was initially called \"Jill and Jessa: Counting On.\"\\n\\nJILL DUGGAR DILLARD\\'S SEX ADVICE DIVIDES SOCIAL MEDIA\\n\\nThe couple claimed TLC producers began to press them to return to the United States for a shoot. Jill and Derick said they refused as they wanted to honor their commitment. They recalled that they had previously told the producers they would be in El Salvador for 10 months.\\n\\n\"Now it\\'s a matter of principle,\" Jill explained. \"Like we\\'re going to be here. That was like the first time that we really put our foot down and said, ‘No.’ I\\'ve never said no to my family before and just been like, \\'No, no, no. We cannot do what you\\'re asking us to do.\\' And it was one of those, like, aha moments for us that basically they\\'re like, ‘Well, you have to.’\"\\n\\nJINGER DUGGAR DETAILS HER DECISION TO WEAR PANTS DESPITE RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING: ‘MY CONVICTIONS WERE CHANGING’\\n\\nShe continued, \"My dad sends us the signature page along with just the obligation section of the contract. I was like, \\'Somebody forged my signature, I\\'m sure of it.\\' And then I look at it like, that is my signature. And that\\'s when we realized that I had signed this the day before we got married. And then I\\'m like, \\'Oh, I remember that. That\\'s not what I thought I was signing.\\'\"\\n\\n\"We never gave our word that we\\'re generally going to be committed to anything,\" Derick said. \"This was fraud.\"\\n\\nThe pair claimed they were told by Jim Bob\\'s manager, Chad Gallagher, that he would have to be present for any discussions with TLC. Jill said that Gallagher told them, \"The contract is not with you. It\\'s through your dad, and I\\'m his representative. So, I have to be involved in these conversations.\"\\n\\n\"And we were not able to talk to TLC,\" Derick noted.\\n\\n\"Honestly, they probably would think if you got a problem with it, you speak up,\" Jill said. \"But it\\'s not the boat that I was in.\"\\n\\n\"Shiny Happy People\" also featured reports that Jill and Derick relied on food banks to support their family while appearing on \"Counting On.\"\\n\\nAccording to Jill and Derick, Jim Bob later offered to pay the older Duggar children a lump sum of money for their participation on the show.\\n\\n\"The amount that he ended up paying in a lump sum to each person, I don\\'t think it would be a coincidence that it would be very close to what minimum wage would be up to 18,\" Derick said.\\n\\nJill added, \"But in order to receive that, you had to sign another deal with my dad, his production company, Mad Family Inc. It would be like forever. We were automatically like, \\'We\\'re done.\\'\"\\n\\n\"We found out on social media that our relationship – if we ever had a relationship with TLC – came to an end at that time,\" Derick said.\\n\\nDERICK DILLARD AND JAZZ JENNINGS SPAR ON TWITTER OVER TRANSGENDER ISSUES\\n\\nJill and Derick announced they were leaving \"Counting On\" in 2017.\\n\\nIn October 2020, the couple told People magazine that they were able to recoup some money from Jim Bob when they hired a lawyer after quitting the show.\\n\\n\"That\\'s when we got an attorney involved and finally recovered some of the money,\" she told the outlet. \"It was a process.\"\\n\\n\"It probably ended up being a little more than minimum wage,\" Derick said in a video that the couple shared to their official Dillard Family YouTube page, per People.\\n\\n\"But we were able to recover at least something,\" he added.\\n\\nIn \"Shiny Happy People,\" Jill and Derick shed some light on where their relations with Jim Bob, Michelle and other members of the Duggar family stand now.\\n\\n\"My dad does control a lot of things within the family,\" Jill said. \"Family relationships were already kind of rocky.\"\\n\\nShe continued, \"I reached out to TLC to ask for all the contracts that I had been involved in. My parents had signed for a bunch of the kids who were no longer minors, including myself. I became an adult in 2009. As the kids aged to adulthood, they\\'re still listed as minors and nobody fixed that.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\\n\\nThe docuseries featured shots of a contract dated May 18, 2012, in which Michelle had apparently signed on behalf of Jill and several of her siblings, who were listed as \"minor children.\"\\n\\n\"Everything within the family dynamic has shifted and not for the better,\" Jill said.\\n\\n\"We’re very much on the outside with the family,\" Derick added.\\n\\nRepresentatives for TLC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nJim Bob and Michelle responded to the docuseries in a statement that they shared on their website.\\n\\n\"The recent ‘documentary’ that talks about our family is sad because in it we see the media and those with ill intentions hurting people we love,\" they wrote. \"Like other families, ours too has experienced the joys and heartbreaks of life, just in a very public format.

And that is one of the main reasons I’m proud to be an American.\"\\n\\nGabriel insisted that despite the glitz and glamour being celebrated on stage, preparing for the Miss Universe competition required serious dedication that is not for the faint of heart. She described \"eating the same thing for the last two years\" to stay in shape.\\n\\n\"Every day I have oatmeal and two eggs in the morning,\" she described. \"And then lunchtime is shrimp and green beans.

So during the competition, it’s two weeks long. I get my spray tan right before I check in. I want to preserve it all the way until finals two weeks later.

The long-lasting popularity helped the show earn a revival in 2018, also titled \"Roseanne,\" starring the original cast, including John Goodman, Sara Gilbert and Laurie Metcalf.\\n\\nShortly into the revival’s run, Barr posted a racist tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett whom Barr insisted from the beginning she believed was not a woman of color.\\n\\nShe took to Twitter to swiftly offer an apology. \"I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me — my joke was in bad taste,\" she tweeted, after writing she was quitting Twitter.\\n\\nROSEANNE BARR SLAMS ABC\\'S DECISION TO FIRE HER FOLLOWING CONTROVERSIAL TWEET: \\'WITCH-BURNING IS WHAT IT IS\\'\\n\\nDespite the apology, the rebooted \"Roseanne\" was canceled, and Barr was dropped from her agency at the time, ICM Partners.\\n\\nA spin-off of the show began airing later that year, titled \"The Conners.\" It featured the remaining family members and revealed in the first episode that Barr’s character had been killed off by an overdose of prescription opioids. The show is now in its fifth season.\\n\\nBarr’s career suffered after the cancelation and the comedian ended up deleting her Twitter account.\\n\\nIn an interview with Tucker Carlson on his Fox Nation series \"Tucker Carlson Today,\" the 70-year-old shared the toll the cancelation took on her.\\n\\n\"I fell in bed and people were calling me and I couldn\\'t even speak,\" she said. \"I mean, I had a nervous breakdown. I couldn\\'t walk or speak or think…\"\\n\\nOver the past five years, Barr has slowly reemerged on the stand-up comedy scene and began performing live again.\\n\\nNow, she has a stand-up special on Fox Nation, titled \"Roseanne Barr: Cancel This!\" along with a documentary about her life and career, titled \"Who Is Roseanne Barr?\"\\n\\nThe stand-up special opens with her joking to the crowd, \"Has anyone else here been fired recently?\"\\n\\nOn \"Tucker Carlson Today,\" Barr discussed her firing over the tweet, saying, \"Any deviation from their fascist boot in your face makes you a racist.\"\\n\\nROSEANNE BARR TAKES CANCEL CULTURE HEAD ON IN STAND-UP COMEDY COMEBACK: \\'I CANNOT LET A--HOLES WIN\\'\\n\\nShe continued, \"I was not allowed to even apologize for what happened. I was just, like, blackballed and just totally canceled from even commenting on what happened, so I thought, \\'Well, stand-up is a great place to come back and say what happened and tell the truth about it and also talk about cancel culture itself and how horrible it is and how fascist…\"\\n\\nBarr also felt that other comedians have fallen victim to cancel culture and it is impacting the comedy world.\\n\\n\"[They] have no livelihood unless they are ridiculously sucking up to what the left considers to be [acceptable],\" she said. \"The left has no humor at all. They have no sense of humor at all, let\\'s be real.\"\\n\\nAs for her comeback, Eldridge says controversy has always been part of Barr’s persona.\\n\\n\"Roseanne\\'s brand, her style, has always been to offend as many people as possible,\" the brand expert told Fox News Digital. \"You can go all the way back to her shout-singing the National Anthem and grabbing her crotch, many years ago. In large part, this was set up to play exactly to her would-be audience—the setback was really a set-up for a come-back.\"\\n\\nCandace Cameron Bure\\n\\nBure rose to fame as a child star on the beloved family sitcom \"Full House\" in the late 80s and early 90s.\\n\\nAfter that, Bure took a break from acting to start a family with her husband, Valeri Bure, and raise their three children, Natasha, Lev, and Maksim.\\n\\nShe eventually returned to TV and became a fixture on The Hallmark Channel in their holiday films and \"Aurora Teagarden\" mystery movie series, and became known as the \"Queen of Christmas\" on the channel. She also appeared in \"Fuller House,\" Netflix’s reboot of \"Full House,\" with most of her original cast mates.\\n\\nIn 2022, it was announced that Bure would be leaving Hallmark for Great American Family, where she now serves as chief creative officer.\\n\\nThe move surprised many, but for Bure it was an opportunity to pursue more faith-based projects, something she is passionate about.\\n\\n\"My faith is so the core and foundation of who I am that sometimes I don\\'t verbally acknowledge it because it\\'s just my assumption,\" Bure told Fox News Digital in November 2022. \"It\\'s like, well, ‘If you get Candace, you get faith.’ It\\'s one and the same. It is with me all the time. It is in all that I do.\"\\n\\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE DISCUSSES \\'DIFFICULT YEAR,\\' HOW FAITH IS HER \\'CORE AND FOUNDATION\\'\\n\\nHowever, Bure made comments about her move that sparked controversy.\\n\\nThe actress told The Wall Street Journal at the time that the network would not feature films with LGBTQ storylines.\\n\\n\"I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core,\" she said in the interview. The Hallmark Channel had announced that its holiday film line-up would feature its first same-sex couple in \"The Holiday Sitter.\"\\n\\nBure later commented on her remark and addressed the backlash in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"All of you who know me, know beyond question that I have great love and affection for all people. It absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone.\"\\n\\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE WON\\'T FEATURE SAME-SEX COUPLES IN FILMS AS SHE\\'S CRITICIZED BY HILARIE BURTON, JOJO SIWA\\n\\nThe 46-year-old continues to be outspoken about her faith.\\n\\n\"It’s hard, no matter what. Especially when you are a compassionate person, and you have a heart for people,\" she said during a podcast interview earlier this year.\\n\\n\"But it’s important that we speak truth in love, ’cause, listen, nobody’s gonna change, nobody’s going to listen to you when it comes out angry, when it comes out in a harsh way, but it’s important that we don’t back down.\"\\n\\nHer first holiday film for Great American Family premiered in November 2022.\\n\\nAccording to a statement from Bure, the film \"A Christmas…Present,\" is about \"slowing down enough to recognize what’s right in front of our eyes.\"\\n\\nBure continued, \"The hustle and bustle of the Christmas season will arrive before we know it but it’s through the quiet moments that we hear God speak to us, directing our path to what’s most important.\"\\n\\n\"A Christmas…Present\" has already earned Bure two awards: best family television prize and the Grace Award for TV performance at the 30th Annual Movieguide Awards. The Movieguide Awards are dedicated to family-friendly entertainment.\\n\\nShe also recently posted her support for Kelsey Grammer’s new religious film, \"Jesus Revolution.\"\\n\\nOn her Instagram, she shared the trailer and wrote in the caption, \"Ultimately I pray this movie is used for His glory, and for people to hear the gospel and turn to Jesus.\"\\n\\nBure is also set to reunite with her \"Full House\" co-stars at 90s Con.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\\n\\nLiam Neeson\\n\\nNeeson has been a Hollywood mainstay, working for decades in dramatic roles, including his Oscar-nominated performance as Oskar Schindler in \"Schindler’s List.\"\\n\\nHe also appeared in somewhat action oriented roles like \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" and \"Batman Begins.\" However, it was his role in 2008’s \"Taken\" that gave the Northern Ireland born star a career renaissance in 2008.\\n\\n\"Taken\" spawned two sequels and a variety of similarly action-themed projects for the actor like \"The Grey,\" \"Non-Stop\" and \"The Commuter.\"\\n\\nThe actor’s hot streak came to a pause though while he was promoting 2019’s \"Cold Pursuit.\"\\n\\nLIAM NEESON TRASHES \\'THE VIEW\\' HOSTS FOR AWKWARD INTERVIEW WITH HIM: \\'WASN\\'T IMPRESSED\\'\\n\\nIn an interview with The Independent published at the time, Neeson recalled an incident where he harbored racist thoughts after a member of his family told him she was raped.\\n\\n\"My immediate reaction was,\" Neeson said before pausing. \"I asked, did she know who it was? No. What color were they? She said it was a Black person.\"\\n\\nNeeson said he then went out with a baton \"hoping I’d be approached by somebody.\"\\n\\n\"After that, there were some nights I went out deliberately into Black areas in this city, looking to be set upon so that I could unleash physical violence. I did it for maybe four or five times. It really shocked me, this primal urge I had. It shocked me and it hurt me. I did seek help. I went to a priest. I had two very good friends I talked to, and believe it or not — power walking — to get rid of this.\"\\n\\nThe comments sparked backlash for the veteran actor, and the red carpet for \"Cold Pursuit\" was canceled. After appearing on \"Good Morning America\" to clarify his comments to Robin Roberts, other promotional appearances were canceled.\\n\\nThere were calls for Neeson to be removed from his other upcoming film \"Men in Black International\" and director Spike Lee declared he would not work with the actor.\\n\\nA month after the initial interview, Neeson released a formal apology. In the statement, he said what happened to his family \"ignited irrational thoughts and do not represent the person I am.\"\\n\\nNeeson has continued to work, appearing in multiple projects, most recently \"Marlowe\" and \"Memory,\" both released in 2022.\\n\\nHe also made a cameo appearance in an episode of \"Atlanta,\" written by Donald Glover. In the episode, he appears as a heightened version of himself and poking fun at the controversy.\\n\\nSPIKE LEE REFUSES TO CAST LIAM NEESON FOLLOWING RACIST COMMENTS\\n\\nDave Chappelle\\n\\nDave Chappelle is a veteran standup comic and actor, beginning in the early 90s. He rose to mainstream fame in 2003 with his Comedy Central series \"Chappelle’s Show,\" where he skewered everything from racism to politics and pop culture in the weekly sketch series.\\n\\nAt the show’s height, Chappelle walked away from it in the middle of producing the third season, citing stress and disagreements with the network over the content of the show.\\n\\nFrom there, the Ohio native focused on stand up comedy, and in 2016 began a lucrative deal with Netflix, which produced six of his standup specials.\\n\\nThe last special, 2021’s \"The Closer\" sparked his most recent controversy. In the special, Chappelle spent a significant amount of time discussing his views on transgender people, which have been deemed transphobic by members of the LGBTQ+ community and others.\\n\\nDAVE CHAPPELLE\\'S 5 MOST CONTROVERSIAL JOKES FROM \\'THE CLOSER\\' NETFLIX SPECIAL\\n\\nNetflix employees walked out in protest of the special’s content, but the company stood by Chappelle.\\n\\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos defended the company\\'s decision not to fire or remove Chappelle\\'s material and called him the \"comedian of our generation.\" He also noted that comedians have to joke about taboo subjects by \"crossing the line every once in a while.\"\\n\\nChappelle has never backed down on his stance and even said he agreed with J.K. Rowling, who had been decried for her position on the transgender community.\\n\\nIn May 2022, the 49-year-old was attacked onstage by Isiah Lee, who was ultimately charged with four misdemeanors. In the moments after the attack, Chappelle joked that it was a \"trans man\" who had attacked him.\\n\\nLater that year, a venue in Minnesota canceled a scheduled appearance by the comedian.\\n\\nOn Twitter, the First Avenue theater wrote, \"To staff, artists and our community, we hear you, and we are sorry. We know we must hold ourselves to the highest standards, and we know we let you down. We are not just a black box with people in it, and we understand that First Ave is not just a room, but meaningful beyond our walls.\"\\n\\nThe canceled appearance sparked a divide on Twitter. Chappelle was also defended by other comedians over the cancelation, with many calling it censorship and a violation of his First Amendment rights.\\n\\nDAVE CHAPPELLE DEFENDS FREEDOM OF SPEECH FROM \\'CANCEL CULTURE\\': \\'FIRST AMENDMENT IS FIRST FOR A REASON\\'\\n\\nDespite the firestorm surrounding him, Chappelle has continued to successfully tour and even hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" for the third time in November.\\n\\nThat appearance drew its own separate controversy over his monologue, which addressed recent antisemitic comments by Kanye West and NBA star Kyrie Irving. Critics thought he was \"normalizing\" antisemitism, while others, including Jon Stewart, thought there was an attempt to do something \"constructive.\"\\n\\n\"Dave said something in the \\'SNL\\' monologue that I thought was constructive, which, ‘It shouldn’t be this hard to talk about things.\\' And that\\'s what we\\'re talking about,\" Stewart, who is Jewish, said on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" at the time.\\n\\nJERRY SEINFELD SAYS \\'SUBJECT MATTER\\' OF DAVE CHAPPELLE\\'S \\'SNL\\' MONOLOGUE \\'CALLS FOR A CONVERSATION\\'\\n\\nChappelle’s special \"The Closer\" continues to draw attention to the comedian. At this year’s Grammy, the comedian took home the Grammy for best comedy album, his fourth Grammy thus far.\\n\\nEldridge says the comedian’s unwillingness to back down, coupled with Netflix’s support of the special, have kept Chappelle from folding.\\n\\n\"Netflix defended him, just as Spotify defended [Joe] Rogan, when the angry mob stood outside the gates,\" Eldridge said. \"In the end, these two links of the chain will need to hold strong in order to support the dangling, dead weight of a cancel culture mob: the accused celebrity must mount a vocal defense and the corporate affiliate (Netflix, Spotify, etc.) must weigh the evidence and make an evidence-based decision, they cannot simply cave, crack, or break under the slightest pressure.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nJohnny Depp\\n\\nJohnny Depp has had a varied career, beginning as a teen heartthrob in \"21 Jump Street,\" before becoming an offbeat idol in Tim Burton films like \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Sleepy Hollow.\"\\n\\nHis biggest claim to fame came with the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, playing Captain Jack Sparrow, the swashbuckling and strange breakout character from the films.\\n\\nDepp was in a relationship with French actress Vanessa Paradis beginning in 1998 before splitting in 2012. The couple had two children together, model and actress Lily-Rose Depp and son, Jack.\\n\\nAfter the breakup, Depp began dating actress Amber Heard, who he had starred with in 2011’s \"The Rum Diary.\" They married in 2015 but divorced one year later, with Heard claiming Depp had been abusive during the relationship.\\n\\nIn 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post that implied she was a victim of domestic abuse. The actress did not refer to Depp by name in the piece.\\n\\nHowever, public backlash against Depp was swift, with fans calling for him to be dropped from the \"Harry Potter\" spin off film series \"Fantastic Beasts.\" He did so after he lost his libel suit in the U.K. after an article was published branding him a \"wife beater.\"\\n\\nJOHNNY DEPP V. AMBER HEARD: BEHAVIORAL ANALYST CONVINCED \\'AMBER WAS THE AGGRESSOR\\' IN RELATIONSHIP\\n\\nDepp went on to sue Heard for defamation, to which she countersued, in a lengthy trial in 2022 that contained shocking allegations of abuse from both parties.\\n\\nUltimately, Depp won his case against Heard with the jury finding in his favor on all five counts and awarding him $15 million in damages. The sum was reduced to 10.3 million by the judge, and Heard was awarded $2 million in her countersuit.\\n\\nThe \"Aquaman\" star later agreed to pay $1 million to settle the claim against her.\\n\\nJOHNNY DEPP VS. AMBER HEARD: A LOOK BACK AT THE BOMBSHELL TRIAL’S TOP FIVE MOMENTS\\n\\nDepp was not present for the verdict but said in a statement \"The jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled. From the very beginning, the goal of bringing this case was to reveal the truth, regardless of the outcome. Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me.\"\\n\\nThe actor had been touring with musician Jeff Beck until his passing earlier this year. He is also set to star in a new film, \"La Favorite,\" about King Louis XV, which will premiere at this year’s Cannes Film Festival in May.\\n\\nAs for the role of Jack Sparrow, \"Pirate of the Caribbean\" producer Jerry Bruckheimer said while he could not answer for Disney on whether they would have the actor back, he did say, \"I would love to have him in the movie. He’s a friend, a terrific actor, and it’s unfortunate that personal lives creep into everything we do.\"\\n\\nIn November, Depp appeared in Rihanna\\'s Savage X Fenty fashion show, making history as the \"first male to take part in this ‘star’ moment.\" Depp\\'s appearance was met with both backlash and support.\\n\\nChris Pratt\\n\\nChris Pratt became a breakout star on NBC’s \"Parks and Recreation,\" playing goofball Andy Dwyer before becoming a Marvel mega star with \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in 2014.\\n\\nHe headlined other major films, including the continuation of the Jurassic Park films in \"Jurassic World,\" and voiced the lead character in \"The Lego Movie.\"\\n\\nDespite his popularity, Pratt has come under fire for a few different things.\\n\\nHe first drew controversy when he made an acceptance speech at the 2018 MTV Movie Awards, where he said, \"God is real. God loves, you, God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do.\"\\n\\nPratt was also accused of attending Hillsong Church, a church popular with celebrities that has also faced anti-LGBTQ+ controversies and misconduct allegations.\\n\\n\"I didn’t know that I would kind of become the face of religion when really I’m not a religious person,\" the 44-year-old told Men’s Health Magazine in June of last year. He added that he has never attended Hillsong Church.\\n\\nThe \"Terminal List\" star was also deemed \"the worst Hollywood Chris\" in a viral tweet that seemed to call out his religious status and suspected political beliefs.\\n\\nPratt’s Marvel co-stars Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., among others, leaped to his defense, as did his now wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger.\\n\\nKATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER SPEAKS OUT ON CRITICISM OF HUSBAND CHRIS PRATT: \\'I SEE WHAT PEOPLE SAY\\'\\n\\nThe relationship between Pratt and Schwarzenegger has generated its own issues. In 2021, he was criticized for posting on social about Schwarzenegger, saying she had delivered a \"healthy daughter.\"\\n\\nFans interpreted the message as a potential insult to his ex-wife Anna Faris and their son Jack, who was born premature and has experienced health issues over the years.\\n\\nHe later told Men’s Health magazine he cried over the criticism.\\n\\n\"That is f---ed up. My son’s gonna read that one day,\" he said of the online discourse. \"He’s 9. And it’s etched in digital stone. It really f---ing bothered me, dude. I cried about it.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t ever wanna get caught complaining or anything \\'cause I have so many blessings,\" he added. \"I consider everything a blessing truly in my life. [But] why are they coming after me?\"\\n\\nFans were also divided over his casting as the video game character Mario in the upcoming \"Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" citing his lack of Italian ancestry and not sounding particularly like the character in the first trailer.\\n\\nCHRIS PRATT EXPLAINS IMPORTANCE OF CORRECTLY PORTRAYING MILITARY AHEAD OF \\'THE TERMINAL LIST\\' DROP\\n\\nPratt did his best to assuage critics, telling Variety, \"It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not going to be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the ‘Mario’ world before.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the upcoming \"Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" Pratt is also voicing Garfield in a new big screen adaptation of the comic strip.\\n\\nThe actor of course continues live action work as well, with \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" releasing in theaters in May.\\n\\nWill Smith\\n\\nWill Smith was widely beloved by audiences around the world, going back to his days as a rapper known as \"The Fresh Prince.\"\\n\\nAfter starring in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" the Philadelphia native became an international blockbuster draw, bringing in millions of dollars with movies like \"Bad Boys,\" \"Independence Day,\" and \"Men in Black.\"\\n\\nSmith also showcased his acting skills, earning Oscar nominations for his roles in \"Ali\" and \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" which also starred his son, Jaden Smith.\\n\\nThe actor earned a double nomination in 2022 for starring in and producing \"King Richard\" about Venus and Serena Williams’ father and his journey to helping them achieve tennis greatness.\\n\\nIn the lead up to the ceremony, Smith was as popular as ever, but that came to a halt during the show when he slapped Chris Rock live on television after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head.\\n\\n2023 OSCARS HIRES ‘CRISIS TEAM’ AFTER WILL SMITH SLAP: A LOOK AT WHO ELSE IS BANNED FROM THE ACADEMY\\n\\nAfter the slap, Smith shouted from the audience for Rock to \"Keep my wife\\'s name out of your f--king mouth!\" though the audio was cut for viewers at home.\\n\\nDespite the shocking moment, Smith went on to win best actor, and apologized for his actions, though not to Rock directly.\\n\\n\"I wanna apologize to the academy. I wanna apologize to all my fellow nominees,\" he said. \"This is a beautiful moment and I\\'m not crying for winning an award. It\\'s not about winning an award for me, it\\'s about being able to shine light on all of the people.\"\\n\\n\"Love will make you do crazy things,\" Smith added. At the time, the LAPD also released a statement stating that the agency was aware of the incident, but that Rock was not interested in pressing charges.\\n\\nThough he apologized, Smith was banned from the Oscars and other events associated with Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for 10 years. He is still able to be nominated for any future work, but will not be allowed at the ceremony.\\n\\n\"I accept and respect the academy’s decision,\" the actor said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital at the time. Smith also resigned from the Academy of his accord.\\n\\nSmith formally apologized to Rock as well, writing on Instagram: \"I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\"\\n\\n\\'EMANCIPATION\\'S\\' WILL SMITH ADMITS HE \\'LOST IT\\' DURING CHRIS ROCK OSCAR SLAP, WAS FULL OF \\'RAGE\\'\\n\\nSince then, the \"Wild Wild West\" star has been able to joke about the moment, most recently in a TikTok.\\n\\nIn 2022, Smith\\'s \"Emancipation\" movie was released on Apple TV+, in which he both starred and executive produced. Smith’s performance was praised, but the film did not become a contender in awards season.\\n\\nThe actor is executive producing a wide variety of projects, including \"Bel-Air,\" the reboot of his breakthrough series \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" Most recently, Smith confirmed that there will be a fourth entry in the \"Bad Boys\" franchise, after the success of the third film, \"Bad Boys for Life,\" released in 2020.',\n",

Both groups were unaware of which treatment they were taking.\\n\\nHEART HEALTH WARNING: MAN SCHEDULED FOR HIP REPLACEMENT WINDS UP WITH QUADRUPLE BYPASS SURGERY\\n\\nNaltrexone is an intramuscular and oral medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat both opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder in adults.\\n\\n\"Naltrexone decreases the reward that you get from drinking,\" Aoun told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nIt works by reducing the release of dopamine, a chemical that makes drinking pleasurable and causes the \"buzz\" feeling from alcohol, Santos added.\\n\\nThe medication \"undermines the purpose of drinking, making it easier for someone either not to drink or if they have a drink, to stop at that, rather than wanting to get a second one,\" Aoun told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nThe standard dose for naltrexone for alcohol use disorder treatment is 50 mg, which patients take every day, Santos said.\\n\\n\"However, a single as-needed dose in the study was tested because one 50 mg dose of naltrexone works quickly, and for a long time — longer than a day.\"\\n\\nThe naltrexone group in the study experienced more nausea, which is a common side effect of the medication; it eventually resolved.\\n\\n\"We recruited a racially and ethnically diverse sample, with 46% of participants being racial/ethnic minorities — 14% African American, 10% Latino, 5% Asian and Pacific Islander, and 17% multi-racial or from another race/ethnicity,\" Santos added.\\n\\nAS EMERGENCY ROOMS SEE MORE OF AMERICA\\'S MENTALLY ILL KIDS, NEW STUDY PINPOINTS ISSUES\\n\\nThe study found that naltrexone reduced binge-drinking frequency over 12 weeks, but not the number of drinking days.\\n\\n\"This is supported by our finding that naltrexone reduced the number of drinks people drank, [so] fewer drinks likely meant fewer days of [specifically] binge-drinking,\" Santos said.\\n\\nThe mean number of drinks in the past month in the naltrexone group was 104.5, compared to 72.9 in the placebo; but by month three, the mean was 64 drinks in the naltrexone group and 80.9 in the placebo.\\n\\n\"Therefore, the mean drinks in that past month decreased by 38.8% for those in the naltrexone group, but it increased by 10.9% for the placebo group,\" Santos said.\\n\\nBut the differences between groups at enrollment for number of drinks in past month were not statistically significant; this particular subset of results may have been explained by chance, he indicated.\\n\\nYOUTH OPIOID OVERDOSES ON THE RISE AS SCHOOLS STRUGGLE TO FIGHT THE EPIDEMIC\\n\\n\"While the two groups started off having a similar number of drinks at the beginning of the study, the naltrexone group had a more significant reduction of drinks at three months,\" Santos said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe naltrexone group experienced more nausea, which is a common side effect of the medication; it eventually resolved as the participants adjusted to the medication.\\n\\nLimitations of the study\\n\\nThe authors examined only sexual and gender minority men in the San Francisco Bay Area, so \"we should be cautious about generalizing the findings,\" said Santos.\\n\\n\"However, the mechanism of action behind naltrexone would apply to other groups beyond this cohort.\"\\n\\n\"Even modest reductions in alcohol use can have positive health impacts.\"\\n\\nHe said further, \"The folks in the study were motivated to reduce binge-drinking through a medication, which might not be true for everyone who binge-drinks.\"\\n\\nThe participants self-reported their behaviors, so this could also bias the results, he noted.\\n\\nPill might help binge-drinkers without alcohol use disorder\\n\\n\"The main implication of the study is that targeted use of naltrexone (or taking it on an as-needed basis) can be an important tool for people interested in cutting down their heavy alcohol use,\" Santos said.\\n\\nHe explained that this flexible approach may help during dates, work holiday parties and family gatherings for those who are not interested in entirely quitting alcohol but still want to have the ability to choose when they don’t want to drink too much alcohol.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\\n\\nThere are not many tools for people without alcohol use disorder who binge-drink to help them decrease the frequency of their episodes, Aoun told Fox News Digital.\\n\\n\"This study showed that targeted naltrexone can be helpful for people who binge-drink and want to reduce the amount they drink, even if they do not have severe alcohol use disorder,\" Santos said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"This is important because even modest reductions in alcohol use can have positive health impacts,\" he also said.',\n",

(SEE Dr. Myers discuss these issues in the video at the top of this article.)\\n\\nSURFER BETHANY HAMILTON SPEAKS OUT AGAINST NEW RULE ALLOWING TRANSGENDER WOMEN TO COMPETE WITH FEMALES\\n\\n\"When a lot of people think about the transgender issue, they imagine drag shows or confused children,\" Myers said.\\n\\n\"But behind all of that is an industry that intends to make a great deal of profit off gender-insecure children — and an ideology that intends to gain a great deal of power from them,\" he added.\\n\\nThe gender dysphoria \"crisis\" emerged just as the internet and social media increasingly took hold of young minds, he said.\\n\\nMore than two-thirds of young women who are diagnosed as gender-dysphoric are found to have been excessively exposed to social media, Myers also said.\\n\\n\"The primary [group] who seems to be targeted by the industry are young women — many of whom feel insecure in their sexuality — especially as they move through puberty,\" he said.\\n\\nThe gender dysphoria \"crisis\" emerged just as the internet and social media increasingly took hold of young minds.\\n\\nHe also said that young girls \"may feel that their emerging sexuality is a threat to them.\"\\n\\nMyers added, \"That would be a pretty sad conclusion, but unfortunately not an uncommon one in a culture that seems to be governed by the sexual revolution, a culture that\\'s ‘porn-ified\\' [and] a culture in which the abuse of young women is startlingly common.\"\\n\\nSummit Ministries, a nonprofit based in Manitou Springs, Colorado, aims to support a \"rising generation to embrace God’s truth and champion the biblical worldview,\" Myers said.\\n\\nAnd while America’s youth have tumbled into a time of social media \"contagion,\" the \"twisting of language\" could also be to blame, he said.\\n\\n\"The maleness and femaleness of humanity are really important to understanding everything else about why we\\'re here on this planet.\"\\n\\n\"It’s a given for a lot of young people today that there is no truth that can actually be discovered by us,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So, the only truth we have is what we socially construct for ourselves.\"\\n\\nPASSOVER\\'S LESSONS TODAY MEAN MORE PERSONAL FREEDOMS, MUCH LESS ‘ENSLAVEMENT,’ SAYS RABBI – HERE\\'S WHY\\n\\nHe added, \"If that\\'s the case, then there\\'s no such thing as male or female.

Those are also concepts that have no meaning if they have no meaning to you personally.\"\\n\\n‘Harmonious’ male and female\\n\\nAs a philosopher and faith leader, Myers pointed out that science and faith are \"not at odds\" with one another.\\n\\n\"From a faith perspective, male and female are not things to be avoided or transcended,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They’re not to be seen as a threat,\" he continued. \"Rather, we’re to see them as harmonious toward one another.\"\\n\\nThe harmony of gender should be viewed in the same way as two roof pitches, Myers said.\\n\\nEither pitch would collapse if it didn’t lean on the other; together they create strength when supporting one another.\\n\\n\"The maleness and femaleness of humanity are really important to understanding everything else about why we\\'re here on this planet,\" he said.\\n\\nHOLY WEEK LEADS THE FAITHFUL TO EASTER SUNDAY: HERE ARE THE SPECIAL DAYS OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY MEAN\\n\\nMyers emphasized how key it is that parents teach this to their children; parents should also openly talk about the influence of social media.\\n\\nOnce children move away from an \"over-attention\" on social media, he affirmed, this strikes a balance for other areas of their lives, including core needs and the ability to invest in others instead of obsessing over self.\\n\\n\"Regulating social media use is one of the most important things parents can do,\" he said. \"It\\'s a battle, unfortunately, that a lot of parents simply don\\'t want to fight because they know that it will be a battle, at least initially.\"\\n\\nParents should speak with their children about what it means to be \"made in God’s image as male and female,\" Myers said.\\n\\nHe continued, \"We want our young men, rather than growing up thinking that they can be predators of those who are weak, to grow up seeing themselves as warriors and defenders and protectors of what is good and true and beautiful,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Regulating social media use is one of the most important things parents can do.\"\\n\\n\"We want young women to grow up with the sense that the life-giving ability that God has given to them is not merely biological, it is [also] sociological — that they can breathe life into other people and communities, and that together men and women can work harmoniously,\" he said.\\n\\nPrioritizing mental health\\n\\nEvery gender-dysphoric child Myers has worked with has had \"severe needs that are much deeper\" than gender, he also said.\\n\\nMany of these kids have depression, anxiety and other forms of mental illnesses that deserve treatment, including childhood trauma, he said.\\n\\n\"There are any number of things that can cause that kind of trauma,\" he also said.\\n\\n\"But if we move people immediately to the gender clinic and say, \\'We will medicalize this — we\\'ll use pharmaceuticals and surgery to fix you,\\' then we are simply saying as a society that we think it\\'s OK to mutilate the body in a futile attempt to heal the mind.\"\\n\\nIn other nations, there has been a \"backing away\" from premature gender-transitional surgeries and an emerging focus on resolving underlying mental co-morbidities, Myers noted.\\n\\nIN D.C., AN UNDAUNTED KIRK CAMERON IS HOLDING A PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOK READING DESPITE PUSHBACK\\n\\nIn 75%-90% of cases in which those mental and emotional needs are met, Myers said gender dysphoric issues dissolve by the time the child reaches the end of puberty.\\n\\n\"The rhetoric and the reality are very different.\"\\n\\nBut this approach is \"very difficult\" for society to agree to, Myers said, especially when there are \"billions of dollars\" to be made off gender medicine and pharmaceuticals.\\n\\n\"And sometimes that aspect of the health care industry pushes the agenda,\" he said.\\n\\n‘Severe physical consequences’\\n\\nStandards set by transgender activists 15 years ago insist that it’s \"medically necessary\" for a child who wishes to transition to do so socially, pharmaceutically and surgically, Myers emphasized.\\n\\nThis includes the use of puberty blockers, such as Lupron, often used to treat prostate cancer and endometriosis.\\n\\nHormone blockers are currently used without FDA approval and may result in \"severe physical consequences,\" Myers warned.\\n\\n\"It is almost virtually guaranteed that [the child] will be sterile,\" he said. \"They will also be a lifelong customer, as long as they want the effects to persist.\"\\n\\nAnd the cost of continuing treatment could rise above $30,000 a year per child, Myers said.\\n\\nTransitional surgeries have become a $2 billion-per0year industry, while pharmaceuticals are raking in \"tens of billions of dollars,\" Myers also said, according to market analyses.\\n\\n\"[That is] the profit that could potentially be gained by pharmaceutical companies by medicalizing young children who are gender-insecure,\" he said.\\n\\nMyers suggested that parents

sexual transition for a gender-confused child.\\n\\nIf they refuse, they\\'re confronted by the medical community with a \"likelihood\" of their child committing suicide, Myers said.\\n\\n\"They terrify caregivers,\" Myers said. \"They make them believe that if they don\\'t start by treating the gender issue first rather than the underlying trauma or other co-morbidities, then they are somehow abusing their child.\"\\n\\nIn his book, Myers debunks the idea that a lack of gender-affirming care increases suicide.\\n\\n\"We [should] not have a society where pharmaceutical companies are

       "  'Faith leaders across the country are reacting to the position taken by surfer Bethany Hamilton on the new inclusion of trans athletes in women\\'s pro surfing.\\n\\nIn the past few days, Hamilton shared her thoughts in an Instagram post, stressing that while she strives \"to have love for all of mankind, regardless of any differences,\" she\\'s also \"concerned as a professional athlete\" and feels \"that I must speak up and stand up\" for others who cannot or won\\'t speak out about a controversial new policy.\\n\\nAmong other thoughts, Hamilton said, \"I personally think that the best solution would be to create a different division so that all can have a fair opportunity to showcase their passion and talent — and I think it\\'s really hard to imagine what the future of women\\'s surfing will be like in 15-20 years down the road if we move forward allowing this major change.\"\\n\\nSURFER BETHANY HAMILTON SPEAKS OUT AGAINST NEW RULE ALLOWING TRANSGENDER WOMEN TO COMPETE WITH FEMALES\\n\\nShe also said, \"I personally won\\'t be competing in or supporting the World Surf League if this rule remains.\"\\n\\nThe World Surf League recently announced that transgender women athletes will need to maintain a testosterone level of 5 nmol/L for at least a year to participate in the women’s division.\\n\\nOn his Facebook page on Monday morning, Rev. Franklin Graham, CEO and president of Samaritan\\'s Purse as well as of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, shared with his millions of followers, \"Bethany Hamilton lost her arm in a shark attack while surfing when she was 13 years old, but survived and has been surfing competitively for 15 years.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand why all women don\\'t stand up in revolt.\"\\n\\nRev. Graham added, \"Now Bethany says she is stepping out of the sport because of a new rule … put in place that allows men to compete in the women\\'s competitions.\"\\n\\nHe also wrote, \"Who makes these rules anyway? It\\'s tragic. I don\\'t understand why all women don\\'t stand up in revolt,\" he added.\\n\\nRev. Graham also said, \"Pray for Bethany and other brave young women like her who are trying to defend what even common sense tells you is right.\"\\n\\nWrote a commenter on Facebook responding to Rev. Graham\\'s post, \"If the only way a man can win is to ‘identify’ as a woman, that is wrong any way you try to spin it!\"\\n\\nSaid another, \"Lord bless her for standing up.\"\\n\\nSaid still another, \"America had got to stand up and stop this nonsense!\"\\n\\nJudge Phil Ginn, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital via email on Monday morning, \"Bethany Hamilton captured our hearts and minds many years ago as the nation watched her triumph over her serious injuries and subsequent inherent fears to get back on her surfboard and learn to excel again in the sport she obviously loves.\"\\n\\n\"Misguided bureaucrats … have decided that having biological males compete with women in sports is somehow a good idea.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"Unfortunately, there has been another setback to her competition. This time it’s not from a shark but from misguided bureaucrats who have decided that having biological males compete with women in sports is somehow a good idea.\"\\n\\nSURFER BETHANY HAMILTON PUSHES PAST FEAR, TAKES ON NEW ADVENTURE\\n\\nSaid Judge Ginn, \"Casting aside the moral issues for a moment, no one who is thinking right can come to the conclusion that creating an obvious advantage for one group over another in sports or any other venue is a good idea. Yet that is exactly what we are now being told by our own government that needs to be done.\"\\n\\nJudge Ginn added as well, \"Title IX was created to prevent these unfair advantages. It was a good idea then and it is a good idea now. Unfortunately, though, we have become so politically correct in America that we can no longer be politically correct.\"\\n\\nDr. Jeff Myers, president of Summit Ministries in Colorado and the author of a forthcoming e-book on transgenderism, told Fox News Digital, \"Bethany Hamilton\\'s instinct on this is correct, and it’s based in reality. The question is not what people identify as — but what they actually are. There are over 6,500 biological differences between males and females, and there’s no changing that.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"At some point, Americans have to grapple with reality. Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports damages all young women in their athletic pursuits.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\\n\\nPatti Garibay, founder and national executive director of American Heritage Girls, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, told Fox News Digital on Monday via email, \"Plaudits to Bethany Hamilton! Her courage to speak the truth in an era when many believe truth is relative and transient is admirable.\"\\n\\nGaribay added, \"Women have fought long and hard for equal treatment over the past century. It is time to uphold the God-given rights described in our nation\\'s founding documents — the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness … whether it be in the ocean, on the field or in the pool. Stay strong, Bethany.\"\\n\\nRyan Bomberger, chief creative officer and co-founder of The Radiance Foundation based in the Washington, D.C., area, \"Men and women are equal, but we’re not the same. Allowing males to compete against females is the left’s new celebrated patriarchy. Under the guise of inclusion, guys get to steal scholarships, records and fairness from women’s sports.\"\\n\\n\"Bethany Hamilton isn’t speaking ‘her truth’; she’s speaking the truth.\"\\n\\nAdded Bomberger, \"It doesn’t matter what drug alterations a self-identifying \\'trans\\' athlete goes through in an attempt to mimic femaleness; he will never be a woman. Science repeatedly confirms the thousands of vast biological differences (both cardiovascular and musculoskeletal) that exist, which largely [give] advantages to men over women in sports long before any chemical testosterone manipulation.\"\\n\\nBomberger also said, \"Bethany Hamilton isn’t speaking ‘her truth’; she’s speaking the truth … The World Surf League’s capitulation to politics and pseudoscience is yet another woke and morally broke effort to erase women and girls.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTrent Talbot, CEO of Brave Books in Texas , which recently published Hamilton\\'s children\\'s book, told Fox News Digital this past weekend, \"What an act of bravery. I stand with Bethany Hamilton and her choice to not participate in the World Surf League if they allow men to compete in the women\\'s division.\"\\n\\nHe also said, \"God designed males and females differently with a purpose – and when we reject this, we reject God. Men do not belong in women\\'s sports.\" He said as well, \"We must take a stand against this progressive movement that would allow men to compete in women\\'s sports. Thank you, Bethany Hamilton,\" he also noted, \"for pushing past fear and standing up for what is right.\"\\n\\nDeirdre Reilly of Fox News Digital contributed reporting.',\n",

       "  'The faithful in America need a two-pronged approach when it comes to handling transgenderism in society today, according to a South Carolina priest.\\n\\nThe first prong, according to Fr. Jeffrey Kirby, author of the book, \"Sanctify Them in Truth: How the Church’s Social Doctrine Addresses the Issues of Our Time,\" is the offering of love and dignity to transgender individuals.\\n\\nThe second prong is offering truth — and, importantly, accepting only truth when it comes to one of the thorniest issues of our time, he said.\\n\\nARIZONA IS SITE OF NEW KIRK CAMERON, SHERIFF MARK LAMB LIBRARY BOOK EVENT: ‘FIGHT ON OUR HANDS’\\n\\nKirby offered an impassioned homily at his church, Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church in Indian Land, South Carolina, on Sunday, April 16. It was posted to YouTube and subsequently was viewed over 5,000 times in one day. (SEE Fr. Kirby deliver his homily in the YouTube link, below.)\\n\\n\"All people of goodwill are called to respect the dignity of each person, especially those that they disagree with and who live differently from them,\" Kirby told Fox News Digital via email this week.\\n\\nFor Christians, \"our response is always one of love,\" he said. \"Hate is never an acceptable response. We seek in all things to speak the truth in love.\"\\n\\nHe made clear that people are not really loving others when they play along with ideas out of a fear of being disagreeable or unpopular.\\n\\n\"Love is not narcissism,\" said Kirby. \"It is not selfish. Love speaks the truth, even when it is hard to hear.\"\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\\n\\nFr. Kirby also had something to say to younger individuals who hope to find their real identities in the promises of \"inclusion.\"\\n\\nThere are young people who are \"jumping on the bandwagon of transgenderism\" because it is a \"popular movement\" that covers itself \"in false messages of tolerance and acceptance,\" he said.\\n\\nNEW JERSEY SHORE TOWN OFFERS PIER IN SHAPE OF THE CROSS DESPITE CRITICISM: ‘CAN’T HIDE OUR FAITH\\'\\n\\nIn his Sunday homily, Kirby referenced the recent Bud Light beer campaign centered around transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney.\\n\\n\"I would never have imagined that Budweiser would have attempted to use transgenderism to promote its products,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The transgender movement has nothing to do with tolerance or acceptance,\" he added.\\n\\n\"Tolerance does not mean that I have to agree with everything someone says.\" He said that actually, \"authentic tolerance establishes an arena for different opinions and views.\"\\n\\n\"Most people cannot imagine the hell that is suffered by people with gender dysphoria.\"\\n\\nKirby offered his thoughts on what true acceptance looks like.\\n\\n\"Acceptance entails affirming a person’s dignity and human rights,\" he said. \"It does not mean that I have to take on and believe whatever the person asserts.\"\\n\\nVIRGIN MARY STATUE WITHSTANDS EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY AS CATHEDRAL COLLAPSES: ‘INSPIRING SYMBOL OF HOPE’\\n\\nHe added, \"The transgender movement does not believe this. For the transgender movement, tolerance and acceptance means submission and uniformity with its beliefs and views.\"\\n\\nKirby then unpacked the stark differences between a human being\\'s true suffering with gender dysphoria versus today’s aggressive transgender ideology.\\n\\n\"We have to make a distinction between the transgender movement and the individual person who suffers from gender dysphoria,\" he said.\\n\\n\"As we speak the truth, we honor and respect the freedom and dignity of all people, even those that disagree or mock our beliefs.\"\\n\\n\"The transgender movement has taken on an ideological life of its own that is far removed from the interior sufferings of the person who has gender dysphoria,\" he emphasized.\\n\\n\"Beyond the activists and those who seek to cause discord, there are real people who are psychologically suffering from gender dysphoria,\" he noted.\\n\\nThey are one gender \"in reality,\" he said — but \"intensely feel\" that they belong to the opposite gender.\\n\\n\"Most people cannot imagine the hell that is suffered by people with gender dysphoria,\" he added. \"These people need authentic help.\"\\n\\nThat help is not found in \"playing along with delusional state of affairs,\" or in the \"manipulation of sex reassignment surgeries,\" he said — but in guiding the person \"through therapeutic means\" to come to \"a greater acceptance of who they truly are and to find peace within themselves.\"\\n\\nKirby continued, \"As Christians, we believe in freedom.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nHe also said, \"We will speak the truth in love, even as we accept the freedom of all people to live however they choose.\"\\n\\nThe Christian faith is \"grounded in freedom and personal accountability,\" he said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\\n\\n\"We will speak about what is right and wrong, as well as the consequences of following what is wrong.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"As we speak the truth, we honor and respect the freedom and dignity of all people, even those that disagree or mock our beliefs.\"',\n",

       "  'Anxiety over academics. Post-lockdown malaise. Social media angst.\\n\\nStudy after study says American youth are in crisis, facing unprecedented mental health challenges that are burdening teen girls in particular. Among the most glaring data: A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report showed almost 60% of U.S. girls reported persistent sadness and hopelessness. Rates are up in boys, too, but about half as many are affected.\\n\\nAdults offer theories about what is going on, but what do teens themselves say? Is social media the root of their woes? Are their male peers somehow immune, or part of the problem?\\n\\nThe Associated Press interviewed five girls in four states and agreed to publish only their first names because of the sensitive nature of the topics they discussed. The teens offered sobering — and sometimes surprising — insight.\\n\\n\"We are so strong and we go through so, so much,\" said Amelia, a 16-year-old Illinois girl who loves to sing and wants to be a surgeon.\\n\\nShe also has depression and anxiety. Like 13% of U.S. high school girls surveyed in the government report, she is a suicide attempt survivor. Hospitalization after the 2020 attempt and therapy helped. But Amelia has also faced bullying, toxic friendships, and menacing threats from a boy at school who said she \"deserved to be raped.\"\\n\\nMore than 1 in 10 girls said they’d been forced to have sex, according to the CDC report, the first increase noted in the government’s periodic survey. Sexual threats are just one of the burdens teen girls say they face.\\n\\n\"We are trying to survive in a world that is out to get us,\" Amelia said.\\n\\nTEEN GIRLS ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT RECORD LEVELS, WITH MANY \\'PERSISTENTLY SAD,\\' DATA REVEALS\\n\\nEmma, an 18-year-old aspiring artist in Georgia with attention deficit disorder and occasional depression, says worries about academics and college are a huge source of stress.\\n\\n\"Lately in myself and my friends, I realize how exhausted everyone is with the pressures of the world and the social issues and where they’re going to go in the future,\" Emma added. \"All of these things pile up and crash down.\"\\n\\nZoey, 15, was raised in Mississippi by a strict but loving single mother who pressures her to be a success in school and life. She echoes those feelings.\\n\\n\"School can be nerve racking and impact your mental health so much that you don’t even ... recognize it, until you’re in this space where you don’t know what to do,\" Zoey said. She’s also had friendship struggles that ended in deep depression and felt the discomfort of being the only Black kid in class.\\n\\nSeveral girls said they face added pressure from society’s standards that put too much focus on how they look.\\n\\n\"A lot of people view women’s bodies and girls’ bodies as sexual,\" Emma said. \"It’s overwhelming to have all these things pushed on us.\"\\n\\nThe #MeToo movement began when these girls were quite young, but it intensified during the pandemic and they’re hyperaware of uninvited sexual advances.\\n\\nBoys are less aware, they suggest. The girls cite crass jokes, inappropriate touching, sexual threats or actual violence. Girls say the unwanted attention can feel overwhelming.\\n\\n\"We deserve to not be sexualized or catcalled, because we are kids,\" Amelia said.\\n\\nSiya, an 18-year-old in New Jersey, said almost every girl she knows has dealt with sexual harassment. \"That’s just been the normal for me,\" she said.\\n\\n\"When you’re walking alone as girl, you’re automatically put in this vulnerable situation,\" Siya said. \"I think that’s so sad. I don’t know what it feels like to not have that fear.\"\\n\\nMakena, a high school senior in Mississippi, said she and her friends sometimes wear baggy clothes to hide their shapes but boys \"comment, no matter what.\"\\n\\nAS EMERGENCY ROOMS SEE MORE OF AMERICA\\'S MENTALLY ILL KIDS, NEW STUDY PINPOINTS ISSUES\\n\\nShe has had depression and therapy, and said she has grown up in a community where mental health is still sometimes stigmatized.\\n\\n\"Often in the Black community we aren’t as encouraged to express emotion\" because of what previous generations endured, said Makena, who works with a teen health advocacy group. \"We’re expected to have hearts of steel,\" she said. \"But sometimes it’s OK to not be OK.\"\\n\\nSocial media platforms contribute, with their focus on superficial appearances and making perfectionism seem attainable. Girls say they’re just part of the problem.\\n\\n\"Social media has completely shifted the way we think and feel about ourselves\" in good and bad ways, Makena said.\\n\\nShe’s felt pressure to be perfect when comparing herself with others online. But she also follows social media influencers who talk about their own mental health challenges and who make it seem \"OK for me to feel sad and vulnerable,\" she said.\\n\\nGirls have historically been disproportionately affected by depression and anxiety. But those statistics at least partly reflect the fact that girls are often more likely than boys to talk about feelings and emotions, said Dr. Hina Talib, an adolescent medicine specialist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\\n\\nZoey, the Mississippi 15-year-old, says boys have to keep up a \"macho facade\" and are less likely to admit their angst.\\n\\n\"I feel like they might feel that way, we just don’t see it,\" she said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nA study published in March in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that in 2019, before the pandemic, about 60% of children hospitalized for mental health reasons were girls. A decade earlier, the difference was only slight.\\n\\nCOVID-19 lockdowns added another dimension, thrusting academic and social lives online, Talib said. Some kids entered the pandemic as youngsters and emerged with more mature bodies, socially awkward, uncertain how to navigate friendships and relationships. They live in a world beset with school shootings, a rapidly changing climate, social and political unrest, and restrictions on reproductive care and transgender rights.\\n\\nThe CDC report released in February included teens queried in fall 2021, when U.S. COVID-19 cases and deaths were still high. Other data and anecdotal reports suggest many teens continue to struggle.\\n\\n\"The pandemic as a percentage of their lives is huge,\" said Talib.\\n\\nExpecting kids to be unscathed may be unrealistic.\\n\\n\"It’s going to change a generation,\" she said.',\n",

       "  'FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., held a \"Women\\'s Empowerment Roundtable\" earlier in March, the video of which is now available online — and among the themes that emerged from the discussion are that freedom, independence and courage are needed more than ever today to stand up to troublesome issues in the culture.\\n\\nJoining Sen. Blackburn were former D1 swimmer Riley Gaines from the University of Kentucky, who was forced to compete in college against a biological male; former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi; former Rep. Mayra Flores of Texas; president of the Judicial Crisis Network, Carrie Severino; and former television anchor and journalist in Nashville, Stacy Case.\\n\\nSen. Blackburn told Fox News Digital exclusively about the forum, \"I was pleased to have such strong and independent women join me to discuss the importance of empowering our next generation of female leaders.

Flores said she was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. at age six — and today remains a proud American who is pursuing the American dream and standing strong for her family especially, she said.\\n\\nShe said her children inspire her in her courage.\\n\\nIn addition, she said her father — as someone who worked in the cotton fields — instilled in her \"the value of hard work.\"\\n\\nAlso, \"I\\'m a proud Border Patrol wife,\" she said.\\n\\nKIRK CAMERON HOSTS STORY HOUR OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY LIBRARY AFTER PUBLISHER SAYS HE WAS DENIED SPACE INDOORS\\n\\nShe is undeterred, she said, about speaking out for the values she cherishes, no matter what the mainstream culture may be suggesting she do or not do.\\n\\nShe said she believes \"that our children\" are the ones who \"give us the motivation to keep on going … They\\'re my biggest inspiration.\"\\n\\nA male swimmer came along and \"knocked\" Riley Gaines \"off the podium.\"\\n\\nRiley Gaines, meanwhile, \"was reaching\" for her lifelong dreams as a college athlete — and \"and then all of a sudden,\" a male swimmer came along, said Sen. Blackburn, and \"knocked you off the podium.\"\\n\\nSo \"what gave you strength to speak out on that?\" ask Sen. Blackburn.\\n\\nGaines said of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, \"A little background. This isn\\'t just a male swimmer who was good swimming as a male and then transitioned to a woman.

How do they push back against the tide of wokeness and indoctrination going on in public schools, in the public square, on social media — and even mainstream media?\\n\\nBethany Bomberger asserts, \"We as Christians don\\'t have the luxury of being silent.\"\\n\\nPRO-LIFE FATHER SHARES BOLD, HOPEFUL MESSAGE: ‘I WAS CONCEIVED IN RAPE, ADOPTED IN LOVE\\'\\n\\nShe and her husband are trying to make it easier for Christian parents to reinforce their biblical beliefs about what it means to be male or female.\\n\\nTheir new book is the latest addition to that fortification. It\\'s an illustrated children\\'s narrative tackling the difficult subject of gender in a simple and direct way.\\n\\nOn \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast, the Bombergers talked about how for centuries the larger culture agreed on the issue of gender. But only in the last decade or two have things become radically different. Their book illustrates that, as well as what the Bible says about gender — and also what science has to say.\\n\\nRyan Bomberger, unfazed by critics says, \"Science is always reinforcing biblical truths.\"\\n\\nThe conflict over gender has become one of the most pressing needs to be addressed.\\n\\nThe Radiance Foundation is a faith-based, pro-life organization working to educate the culture on life-shaping issues.

Ortega, Mark Oshiro, Robin Gow and Mariama J. Lockington. The panel primarily discussed reaching out to a young audience in the midst of several book challenges and \"bans\" targeting their stories.\\n\\nWhile remarking on book bans, the writers insisted that kids, unlike adults, have been vastly supportive of their efforts.\\n\\nPARENTS PROTEST MARYLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT’S LGBTQ CURRICULUM: ‘WANT A RIGHT TO SAY WHAT OUR KIDS ARE LEARNING’\\n\\n\"The kids get it, and that’s who I write for,\" Ortega said. \"And adults are just going to have to deal with it.\"\\n\\nLockington also remarked, \"I kind of feel like I’m doing something right if I’m pissing people off with my stories in some way. I also really try to focus on the fact that the feedback I’m getting from young people is always the opposite of what gatekeepers and adults are saying about what young people can handle or what they have going on their lives. We do a real disservice when we underestimate and overlook what young people are holding today.\"\\n\\nTransgender woman and writer Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu was also featured as a key speaker during the conference where the author described the concept of māhū, a Hawaiian term referencing a \"traditional third-gender person who occupies the space between kane (male) and wahine (female).\"\\n\\n\"Back home you can be one, or the other, or both,\" Wong-Kalu said. \"Western minds struggle with the understanding that there’s something beyond the physicality.\"\\n\\nAccording to its description, Wong-Kalu’s picture book \"Kapaemahu\" is about four māhū \"extraordinary individuals of dual male and female spirit\" and is based on an Indigenous legend. While the age range is listed as 4-8 years old, Wong-Kalu claimed that it was \"for all ages.\"\\n\\n\"This book is for all ages and, in fact, I used it in my prison class,\" Wong-Kalu said. \"They enjoyed the book because it gives a doorway, it creates access, to yet one more story of our people. Our stories have been suppressed, hidden, and denigrated for so long.\"\\n\\nLGBTQ ORG SAYS ITS \\'RAINBOW LIBRARY\\' PROGRAM HAS ENCOURAGED KIDS TO \\'COME OUT\\' TO TEACHERS: \\'THEY TRUST\\' THEM\\n\\nAhead of the conference, the ALA put out a press release on June 20 promoting it\\'s updated guide \"LGBTQIA+ Books for Children and Teens,\" which is intended for \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, asexual, and intersex readers and their allies.\"\\n\\nThe book touts authors explaining \"not only why they write for children, but what they feel librarians and teachers should understand when working with queer children and their classmates,\" as well as spotlighting \"picture books for young children that depict kids, parents, and families with a variety of gender and sexual dynamics.\"\\n\\nThe ALA conference featured several diversity panels and sessions, such as \"Reflecting the Diversity of Your Community in Your Collection,\" \"Tradition or Discrimination: Is Your Beloved Team Mascot Cultural Appropriation?\" and \"Equity and Diversity in the Metaverse: Building a sustainable metaverse for libraries.\"\\n\\nBook bans were another frequent topic with sessions like \"Changing the Narrative: ALA Policy Corps Takes on Book Banners\" and \"Fight Book Bans: Frame the Debate, Fill the Seats, and Create Connections;\" the latter specifically discussed how to battle Moms for Liberty.\\n\\nCritical race theory activist Ibram X. Kendi spoke at the conference\\'s \"Rally for the Right to Read: Uniting for Libraries & Intellectual Freedom\" Thursday.\\n\\nKIRK CAMERON AND HIS BOOK PUBLISHER REPORT ‘SABOTAGE’ AGAINST PRO-FAITH PARENT GROUPS AHEAD OF LIBRARY EVENT\\n\\nAccording to an ALA publication\\'s write-up of the event, Kendi compared today\\'s \"book bans\" to the Alabama Slave Code of 1883 that prohibited teaching slaves to read.\\n\\nThe article said, \"Jim Crow-era segregationists separated out Black people and Black stories, banning anti-racist books from their libraries and schools. Kendi emphasized that the ideological descendants of enslavers and segregationists are today still legislating for ignorance, via book bans.\"\\n\\nALA did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nRecent footage from an ALA Zoom presentation in early June came under fire after it appeared to show a spokesperson for the association offering ways to push back against the upcoming national \"See You at the Library\" event led by actor and writer Kirk Cameron.\\n\\n\"Libraries are for receipt of information. That means that the First Amendment does not require the library to even offer meeting room spaces. So in regard to the Kirk Cameron thing, you are not obligated to offer public meeting room spaces or invite the public in to use the library,\" the spokesperson said in a video publicly available on YouTube.',\n",

       "  'A New York Times guest essay by American Medical Association president Jack Resnick, Jr. blasted the legal challenge against the abortion pill mifepristone as \"one of the most brazen attacks yet against reproductive health.\"\\n\\nEarlier this month, U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk issued an injunction to halt the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s approval of the drug. Although the pill was previously approved in 2000, the FDA made drugs like mifepristone more widely available under the Biden administration.\\n\\nMany Democratic officials and medical organizations came out against the decision with Resnick calling it \"a chilling attempt to intimidate patients and physicians alike\" over various other drugs.\\n\\n\"With ever-growing anti-science aggression, disinformation campaigns and vitriol about all types of medical advancements, there is no telling where the court challenges may lead — perhaps even to widely used drugs now sold over the counter to treat pain, allergies or heartburn that happen to have been studied with fetal stem cells,\" Resnick wrote.\\n\\nABORTION PROVIDERS PUSHING HANDHELD ABORTION TECH TO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS ACROSS U.S.: ‘A GAMECHANGER’\\n\\nKacsmaryk’s decision was partially overturned by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, though it maintained restrictions for mifepristone to only be dispensed up to seven weeks and not be delivered by mail. The Supreme Court also allowed temporary access to the drug until Friday after the Department of Justice (DOJ) appealed the case.\\n\\nResnick claimed that, should the Supreme Court choose to not remove all restrictions on the drug, it would compromise \"the integrity of the long-established F.D.A.-approval process and whether we want science — or ideologues — informing decisions about our individual and collective health.\"\\n\\n\"We simply cannot be a country where your access to the care you need is determined by the whims of ideologically driven judges and lawmakers without medical or scientific training. That’s why a dozen of the nation’s leading medical organizations, including the one I head, the American Medical Association, strongly oppose this politically motivated assault on patient and physician autonomy and have filed amicus briefs to make our case,\" Resnick wrote.\\n\\nHe added, \"We cannot allow pseudoscience and speculation to override the substantial weight of scientific evidence from more than 100 studies and millions of patients that confirm the safety and efficacy of a drug or course of treatment.\"\\n\\nRON DESANTIS SIGNS SIX-WEEK ABORTION LAW, DELIGHTING PRO-LIFERS AND ‘DEVASTATING’ ABORTION SUPPORTERS\\n\\nThe American Medical Association, which is one of the largest health care associations in the country, previously referred to abortion restrictions as a \"violation of human rights\" ahead of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June.\\n\\n\"Responding to the growing threat of over-policing and surveillance of reproductive health services, the nation’s physicians and medical students at the AMA Annual Meeting adopted policy recognizing that it is a violation of human rights when government intrudes into medicine and impedes access to safe, evidence-based reproductive health services, including abortion and contraception,\" the statement read.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe American Medical Association also called for the DOJ to investigate \"disinformation campaigns\" against hospitals providing transgender surgeries for minors.',\n",

It’s Me, Margaret’ has been banned for featuring middle schoolers talking about the menstrual cycle, while in 1973’s ‘Deenie,’ teenage girls learn about and engage in masturbation. ‘Forever’ (1975) follows a high school senior who learns to stop fearing sex as she enters her first serious relationship.\"\\n\\nBlume remarked on this, saying, \"In the ’80s is when it all broke loose, after Reagan’s election.\" Blume also mentioned how the prinicipal of her own kids’ elementary school banned \"Margaret\" from the library shelves. She said, \"He believed that menstruation wasn’t a topic that girls should read about, nevermind how many kids already had their periods.\"\\n\\nBlume mentioned that this censorship is getting worse. She told the outlet, \"It was bad in the ’80s, but it wasn’t coming from the government. Today, there are laws being enacted where a librarian can go to prison if she or he is found guilty of having pornography on their shelves. Try and define pornography today and you’ll find that it’s everything.\"\\n\\nIt was clear Blume was taking aim at conservatives’ efforts to get inappropriate books out of children’s school libraries. Towards the end of the interview she said, \"No child is going to become transgender or gay or lesbian because they read a book. It’s not going to happen. They may say, ‘Oh, this is just like me.

But in the long term, things usually revert back to the mean,\" he said.\\n\\nThe appetite for news and analysis of the Bud Light debacle is still strong, and Beer Business Daily, a niche publication which focuses on the North American commercial beer industry, has exploded in popularity.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t really seen it since 2008 when Miller bought Coors, or they merged and InBev bought Anheuser-Busch. So, yeah, there\\'s tremendous interest in this and our traffic on our website is blowing up,\" Schuhmacher said. \"It\\'s a story that just won\\'t die.\"\\n\\nCEO DISTANCES ANHEUSER-BUSCH FROM BUD LIGHT DYLAN MULVANEY CONTROVERSY: \\'NOT A FORMAL CAMPAIGN\\'\\n\\nAs conservatives have distanced themselves from Bud Light, retail juggernaut Target has found itself in a similar boat. Target is under fire for over-the-top LGBTQ Pride displays, and the store has been widely criticized for including children’s products and \"tuck\" friendly bathing suits. Some Targets in rural areas were forced by corporate rulers to move the Pride sections to less-trafficked areas of the stores because executives feared a \"Bud Light situation\" emerging, an insider previously told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nSchuhmacher understands why the beer giant has caught more flak up to this point.\\n\\n\"In the public psyche, Bud Light has always been considered so much of a deep Americana, middle America, working man and woman\\'s beer. And when you just flip that completely on its end, it\\'s hard for the consumer to swallow,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I think the difference, you know, Target is more geared towards women, high-end middle American women,\" Schuhmacher continued. \"But Bud Light is not that far in the middle of the spectrum, at least in the consumer\\'s mind of where it\\'s supposed to be.\"',\n",

Shortly after his inauguration in 2021, the White House invited a professional bagpiper for St. Patrick’s Day, much like many Irish-American events that mix general Celtic traditions, to which Biden replied, \"They really know how to make an Irishman feel special at the White House.\" He has also made the internet cringe with statements like \"I may be Irish, but I\\'m not stupid.\"\\n\\nHowever, in a time of year many remember Ireland’s most famous holy man as well as the legacy of the Irish culture around the world, one writer chose to roast the American president for his leadership and moral character.\\n\\n\"President Joe Biden’s self-delusion seems to be boundless. When he looks in the mirror, he apparently sees an upright Irish Catholic true to the historic values of his deeply rooted religious identity,\" Ruth Dudley Edwards wrote in the Telegraph. \"He is, in fact, an appalling Catholic who publicly flouts the church’s most cherished teachings and is about as authentically Irish as a leprechaun hat in a St Patrick’s Day parade.\"\\n\\nGRAND ST.

Greg Abbott and Florida Gov.

       "  'President Biden held a rare press conference on Tuesday, and the unusual occurrence only underscored to an increasingly annoyed media how inaccessible he has been compared to his predecessors.\\n\\nA longtime Washington correspondent told Fox News Digital the expectation that Biden should stand before reporters and consistently answer questions was \"pretty basic.\"\\n\\n\"I think there\\'s a lot of frustration that there have been so incredibly few press conferences and so few opportunities generally to ask questions of the president,\" they said. \"It\\'s a fundamental thing. You know that the press corps has a job and it\\'s not just reporters trying to get questions asked for their own personal well-being… You\\'re representing your viewers and your readers and your listeners.\"\\n\\nAdded a White House correspondent: \"There are serious concerns in the White House press corps about the way staff are hiding the president… I would be surprised if Biden has another full solo press conference again in the remainder of his political career.\"\\n\\nBIDEN BELITTLED FOR USING ‘CHEAT SHEET’ WITH REPORTER\\'S QUESTION PRE-WRITTEN ON IT: ‘IT’S NO SURPRISE\\'\\n\\nThe New York Times noted last week that Biden has held the fewest news conferences of any president since Ronald Reagan, holding just his 24th on Tuesday according to the American Presidency Project. He only granted 54 interviews in the first two years he held office, compared to 202 by President Trump and 275 by President Obama. In response to the criticism, a White House official told the Times Biden had held \"nearly 400\" question-and-answer sessions, which even the newspaper noted were often \"very brief.\"\\n\\n\"More than any president in recent memory, Mr. Biden, 80, has taken steps to reduce opportunities for journalists to question him in forums where he can offer unscripted answers and they can follow up,\" The New York Times reported.\\n\\nWhen he has done conferences, he\\'s been prepared. At Tuesday\\'s conference alongside South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, photographers caught a glimpse of his notes which suggested knowledge of Los Angeles Times reporter Courtney Subramanian\\'s question about chip manufacturing ahead of time. The newspaper denied she had submitted her question before she asked it.\\n\\nAll presidents and their respective press corps have mutual frustrations. While Trump was at times more than eager to hold forth with the press, he was accused of favoring conservative outlets, and his rhetoric about the media being the \"enemy of the people\" in response to intensely negative coverage generated an acrimonious relationship.\\n\\nBiden, more than aware of the mutual disdain between Trump and reporters, knew he had a low bar to clear to win their approval as he took office. His first press secretary Jen Psaki – now an MSNBC host – won plaudits from the likes of CNN\\'s Brian Stelter for promising to tell the truth and restore daily briefings. And he\\'s seemingly realized there\\'s little downside to spurning the press, beyond humoring a few shouted questions at times by Marine One on the White House lawn, if the most they do is grumble from time to time about it.\\n\\n\"I have no doubt that is the way [White House aides] view it, that there\\'s a greater risk of the president saying something and getting thrown off message than there is of having people upset that he\\'s not holding press conferences,\" the Washington correspondent said. \"I mean, one\\'s a pretty low risk. One\\'s a pretty high risk. But I just look at it in terms of the fundamental responsibilities of the job. I also think it often backfires when the people around a president or a presidential candidate feel that they have to so carefully manage all of his interactions with anybody who might ask a question.\"\\n\\nThe Times pointed out that \"only Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan held as few news conferences each year as the current occupant of the Oval Office\" in the 100 years since Calvin Coolidge took office.\\n\\nBIDEN PRESSED ABOUT AGE IN 2024 RACE, ADMITS HE \\'CAN\\'T EVEN SAY THE NUMBER\\'\\n\\n\"The president’s strategy of keeping the press at arm’s length is a bet that he can sidestep those traditions in a new media environment,\" Times reporter Michael Shear wrote.\\n\\nBiden formally announced his 2024 re-election bid this week, in a far different environment than how he was able to run once he captured the Democratic nomination in 2020, a year defined by the coronavirus pandemic. Now, staying hunkered down won\\'t be as easy to pull off.\\n\\n\"Biden absolutely needs to get out in the media and defend his agenda, his age, and his campaign, but aides will obviously weigh the benefits and the pitfalls of putting him on a camera they don\\'t control,\" the White House correspondent said.\\n\\nOutspoken White House reporter Simon Ateba, who has at times fiercely clashed with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, said the more Biden opens himself up, the more it creates an opening for Republicans due to his penchant for gaffes.\\n\\n\"This might also backfire if the Republican nominee eventually begins to perform well and do multiple interviews that the American people can connect with. Biden is not very eloquent and charming when it comes to presentation of his ideas,\" he told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nHe added \"frustration has been growing in the briefing room,\" noting Biden has never once come to answer questions there.\\n\\n\"Those reporters can only blame themselves as a few of them have antagonized me multiple times as I kept asking for access and urging the press secretary to call on me and other reporters in the back of the room,\" he said.\\n\\nBiden faced backlash in October when he sat down for a conversation with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney, who has since gained prominence over a disastrous partnership with Bud Light.

Dr. Ganor holds full medical licenses in MA and NH and completed two Harvard Medical School fellowships.\"\\n\\nBefore the policy decision on allowing minors to get vaginoplasties was finalized, Director Ganor expressed uncertainty whether Massachusetts laws would allow the procedure since it can render a minor patient permanently sterile.\\n\\n\"MA Law is unclear on whether parents can consent to procedures that result in sterilization,\" Ganor said in a publication from Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nIn order to address the possible legal concerns, the hospital came up with a policy to offer a court order option for a genital surgery on a minor.\\n\\nThe article said in 2019 that when the policy was first implemented, it offered the court order a pathway to a family who accepted. \"[T]he only family to which this option has been offered has decided to pursue the court order,\" according to the medical journal article.\\n\\nUpon being confronted by Fox News Digital with the journal article, Children\\'s said that it \"follows all laws and regulations. We do not and have not provided genital surgeries on patients under 18-years-old in connection with Gender Affirming Care.\"\\n\\nMEDICAL SCHOOL PROFESSOR SAYS PARENTS MUST IMPLEMENT GENDER IDEOLOGY FOR BABIES: \\'IT... STARTS AT BIRTH\\'\\n\\nFox News Digital asked whether the hospital was accusing its clinicians of lying about the policy they had noted in multiple medical journal articles, and whether it would launch an investigation, but it did not offer a response specifically addressing that question.\\n\\nIt appeared that at some point BCH shifted its policy on genital surgeries on 17-year-olds as demonstrated, at least in part, by the removal of language regarding vaginoplasty eligibility for 17-year-olds from its website.\\n\\nMedical literature co-authored by BCH chief anesthesiologist Joseph Cravero and Director Ganor, published in March 2022, a few months before the controversy broke, acknowledged that BCH was \"the first pediatric center in the United States to offer… genital surgeries for those over 17 years of age.\"\\n\\nNew England Gender CARE, which is partnered with BCH, said on its website as of May 16, 2023, that Children\\'s offers psychological gender identity counseling to kids as young as 4. It added that BCH offered vaginoplasties to 17-year-olds. CARE was founded by a current researcher and social worker at BCH\\'s Center for Gender Surgery, Elizabeth Boskey.\\n\\nBoskey was involved from the beginning in creating the seed policy of the gender surgery center. She presented to the hospital ethics committee in order to formulate the gender surgery unit at Children’s, according to the medical journal article from 2019.\\n\\n\"In the four years since its inception, [the Center for Gender Surgery] has completed over 300 gender-affirming surgeries,\" including chest surgeries, which are eligible for 15-year-olds, BCH clinicians said in an article published at the Journal of Clinical Medicine.\\n\\nAnother issue considered by the hospital when implementing the vaginoplasty policy for minors was the \"extensive post-surgical care required by the procedure,\" the article said.\\n\\nPatients recovering from vaginoplasties have to be in the intensive care unit for at least a week and will use a catheter to urinate temporarily.\\n\\nThe recovery time runs up to 18 months, and requires a lifetime of dilating the \"vagina to keep it open,\" according to Boston Children\\'s Hospital.\\n\\n\"[W]e are deeply disappointed that Fox News continues to mischaracterize the lifesaving and life changing medical care we provide to young people,\" Boston Children\\'s Hospital said in a statement. They did not accept a request to be interviewed for this article.\\n\\nWhen Fox News Digital requested the research upon which the institution relied to perform gender surgeries on minors such as double mastectomies, BCH did not offer a response specifically addressing that request.\\n\\nIn fact, Children\\'s own senior doctors – including Ganor – have admitted the lack of research on the topic.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, there is extremely limited published research on the impact of chest surgeries on the pediatric and young adult population,\" they said in a published medical journal article. They similarly reiterated the lack of research on genital surgeries for the young adolescent population.\\n\\nOne of Children\\'s first phalloplasty patients – who was over 18 – was in and out of the ICU for weeks after the procedure due to several complications, the patient told WBUR.\\n\\nThe surgery took 14 hours.\\n\\nA phalloplasty is a procedure with a high-complication rate in as high as 51%, according to an article entitled \"Reconstructive Urology and Trauma\" from Temple University Hospital. It entails surgeons harvesting one or more flaps of skin and other tissues from a donor site, such as a forearm, and using it to form a penis and urethra.\\n\\n\"Doctors took a rectangle of skin, tissue and blood vessels from [the patient\\'s] right forearm to shape a penis and extend the urethra to the tip. [The patient] was in and out of the hospital for several weeks with complications,\" the local WBUR article said about the Children\\'s procedure.\\n\\nA surgeon at Children’s Center for Gender Surgery program, Dr. Amir Taghinia, told a local outlet that phalloplasties have routine complications, but the more the hospital is able to perform, the better the outcomes will be for future patients.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"We at Children\\'s have the resources to look at these types of procedures through many different angles and develop ways of improving those,\" Taghinia said.\\n\\nBoston Children\\'s Hospital received nearly $300 million last year from the federal government, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security.',\n",
